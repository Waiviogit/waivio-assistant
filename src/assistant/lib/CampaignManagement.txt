- **Pending**: This status indicates that the sponsor has created a campaign. The campaign is only visible in the [Manage](https://www.waivio.com/rewards/manage) tab and can still be edited. At this stage, the campaign has not yet been recorded on the blockchain and exists only in the database.

# Match bots are services implemented on the Waivio platform that automatically vote on content produced by specific authors or content based on specific criteria. There are three types of match bots: Authors Match Bot, Curators Match Bot, and Sponsors Match Bot.


# Earn. Match bots. Authors.
**Authors match bot** monitors the publication of new posts by the specified authors and, after 5 minutes, votes for them if the Voting Power at that moment is not less than the specified one (upvote mana). This parameter is different for each author. The strength of the voice can range from + 0.1% to + 100% (max upvote). This bot does not vote for comments or re-blogs. Authors match bot has its own authorization. So far, the bot is limited to only positive votes. In order not to publish votes with a small value, it makes sense to estimate the weight of the vote and if it is less than 0.01 HBD (1 cent), then ignore it.
## How It Works (Simplified Version)
1. A user enables the Authors Match Bot authorization.
2. The user adds an author.
3. The author writes a post.
4. The user's like automatically appears on the post after 5 minutes.
Link to Authors match bot: https://www.waivio.com/rewards/match-bots-authors. (This feature is available only on the Waivio main domain and will not work on social sites)
## Authors Match Bot Page
**Title**: Authors Match Bot
**Switch**: This switch controls the authorization status of the bot. A red switch indicates that the bot is inactive, while a green switch indicates it is active.
**Description**:
  - The Authors match bot automatically upvotes posts published by the specified authors. It does not upvote comments or re-blogs.
  - For each author, please specify the upvoting power in the range from +1% to +100% (maximum upvote). Actual value of the upvote depends on the current upvoting mana on the account at the time of the action.
  - Important: The Authors match bot only publishes upvotes with estimated combined value of 0.01 HBD or more. Votes will be processed as long as the mana (voting power) on the account remains above the threshold as specified for each author.
**Authorization Block**:
  - The Authors match bot requires authorization to distribute votes on your behalf.
  - The authorization is completed via HiveSigner and can be revoked at any time.
  - **Disclaimer**: The service is provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis.
**Link**: "Authorize now" link for bot authorization. If the bot is active, this link changes to "Remove authorization."
**Add Author Button**: Click the "Add author" button to open a modal window for adding new authors.

# Earn. Match bots. Curators
**Curators match bot** repeats the curators' voices with a specified coefficient (from 1% to 10 000%). By default, the bot repeats only positive votes, but if the user specifies (ticks the check box), then downvotes are repeated with the same coefficient. 
In this case, the table uses the ± symbol in front of Vote ratio to indicate that negative votes are also repeated. For each curator, min Voting Power is set (upvote / downvote mana). If the estimated value of the vote is less than 0.01 HBD, then such a vote will not be played.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe9a7df2-3175-40c8-b8c3-594f619c812b)
## How It Works (Simplified Version)
1. A user enables the Curator Match Bot authorization.
2. The user adds a curator.
3. The curator gives likes and dislikes.
4. The user’s likes and dislikes automatically appear on the post.

## Curators Bot Page Information
- **Title**: Displays as "Curators match bot."
- **Switch**: A toggle switch for activating or deactivating the bot. It appears red when inactive and green when active.
- **Description**:
  - The Curators match bot automatically repeats the upvotes and downvotes of specified users (curators) on posts and comments.
  - For each curator, please specify the voting ratio - the proportion of your vote to the curator's vote. For example, 100% means that you want the same vote as the curator. Sometimes, if your vote value is less than the curator's, you can amplify your vote. If you specified a 200% vote ratio and the curator voted 10%, your vote would be 20%. Please note that all votes are capped at a maximum of 100%.
  - Important: Important: If the estimated combined value of the vote is less than 0.01 HBD, the Curator match bot will skip this vote. If you also want to repeat curator’s downvotes, please check the corresponding box. Votes will be processed as long as the mana (voting power) on the account remains above the threshold specified for each curator.
- **Auth Block**:
  - **Authorization Requirement**: "The Curators match bot requires authorization to distribute votes on your behalf: Authorize now. Authorization is completed via HiveSigner and can be revoked at any time."
  - **Disclaimer**: "The Curators match bot service is provided on an as-is / as-available basis."
- **Link**: A link labeled "Authorize now" for initiating the authorization process.
- **Add**: A button labeled "Add curator" to add new curators. Clicking this button opens a modal window titled "Add new curator".
*Note: The "Authorize now" link will change to "Remove authorization" when the bot is active.*

# Earn. Match bots. Sponsors
**Sponsors match bot** - is an account for paying part of the reward for reviews in the form of votes, thereby reducing the amount of direct payment. 
If a user wants to become a Match bot, he needs to activate the toggle on the "Rewards" page in the "Sponsors" tab. For example the user has posted a review that is eligible to receive a direct reward of 5.00 WAIV. 
Match bot can upvote that post for a specified value of, say, 10% of the reward (assuming Match bot has enough voting value). This way, the user will receive 0.50 WAIV in author's rewards and the direct payment can be reduced to 4.50 WAIV. In order for the sponsor to add a match bot to the campaign. 
The Match bot should in turn add a sponsor. To do this, in the "Sponsors" tab, click on the "Add sponsor" button.
Link to Sponsor match bot: https://www.waivio.com/rewards/match-bots-sponsors. (This feature is available only on the Waivio main domain and will not work on social sites)

In the modal window, you need to fill in the fields:
* choose a sponsor;
* determine the strength of the voice;
* select the date until which the match bot will be active (optional);
* write a comment (optional).
And click "Add sponsor" with further confirmation of the action in the modal window "Rule create confirmation".
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67378322/133735200-fa8a9c5e-8f4c-40d9-846d-b7ef9f5ae8da.png)

After refreshing the page, the sponsor is added to the bot's match list. And the sponsor can add a match bot to their campaigns.
Additional functionality:
* deactivation of the sponsor: after clicking on the checkbox in the "Active" column
And confirmation of the action in the "Confirm rule inactivation" modal window

## How It Works (Simplified Version)
1. A user enables the Sponsor Match Bot authorization.

# How To Manage Rebates and Payments On Waivio
This tutorial focuses on managing rewards and payments for active campaigns. We will look at the process from both user and sponsor perspectives.
Users can reserve rewards for a few days (as indicated on the reward card) and be assured that the offer will not disappear when they are ready to submit the review.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605647737_01988c1a-bdc9-4267-b2c5-d7462d9729b6
When the user makes a reservation, the sponsor receives a notification. The sponsor can view the status of all reservations in Campaign/Reservations, and can filter them by status (reservered, completed, expired, etc.) and campaigns (1).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605647782_be0bc881-0b38-4de2-9a26-a1ba00766429
At this point, the sponsor can view the reservation, release it or even increase the reward for that specific reservation (2).
Users can view a list of all active reservations in Rewards/Reservations (3), check the number of days remaining, release reservations they no longer intend to complete or start to write the review (5).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605651694_98169f4e-998e-4674-a8d7-fef87208ed55
Completed and expired reservations will be removed from Rewards/Reservations, but can still be viewed in Rewards/History (4).
In order for a review to be eligible for the reward, certain criteria must be met. For this campaign, the post must have at least two original photos of the dish and links to the dish and the restaurant. When the user begins the review writing process, the links are already pre-filled in the review draft (6).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605651995_6cbd5140-d057-4e0b-b1f4-e84e77790716
And when the user adds photos (7) and some text, the review is ready to be published. Users can add additional tags (8) and object links for better discovery of their post.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605652599_9f445ccc-8b7a-4201-87b8-6a3cfe978833
Once the review is published, it will appear in the user's profile, on the linked pages of the restaurant, dish and hashtags. It will also appear in the news feeds of other users who follow this user or one of the objects mentioned in this review (10).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605653041_0b21f1a4-7153-49aa-806b-d00ff994504d
At the same time, the sponsor will also receive a notification (11), informing them that a qualified review has been published and the status of this reservation will change to "Completed" (12).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605653364_c88a401b-5025-4d68-b1ba-2275610db8c3
The sponsor can now open the review, examine the detailed report and, if he or she suspects that the submission is fraudulent, reject it or even blacklist the user, making them ineligible to participate in any future campaigns of that sponsor (13).
While the sponsor is examining the review, the user can open Rewards/Receivables (14) to see a list of all sponsors who currently owe payments to them.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605653736_eeb072d5-4983-440a-a694-03b332b89112
In this example, there is only one such account and the user can click on the link to view the rewards and payments history (15).
For each eligible submission, additional information is provided (16), including links to the review, linked objects and the beneficiaries of the author rewards. Please note that awards will be distributed to all beneficiaries based on the percentages stated in the post.
In this example, 97% of the rewards will go to the author, while 3% will be paid to the application (Waivio) that was used to submit the review. The list of beneficiaries and their shares can be edited at the post preview stage (9 - Advanced settings).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605654988_933179c6-1d03-4375-bcf1-2167f4f77cf4
We will examine the detailed report for an older review (17), because it already includes the values for all upvotes.
Rewards are stated in USD, but are paid in HIVE (18). The exact amount of HIVE is calculated at the time of reservation based on the current exchange rate (19).
The reward will be paid in the form of a combination of upvotes (Hive Power - 20) and direct payments (liquid HIVE - 21). Only upvotes from registered accounts (22) count towards the payment of rewards. The value of all other upvotes is not subtracted from the specified amount of the reward.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605661422_8efca8a2-83cb-41bf-b65e-7304caae3bcf
And the outstanding amount in the liquid HIVE (23) is what the sponsor is supposed to pay the user for this review.
Sponsors can use Campaigns/Payables (24) to quickly distribute funds to users, including guests (name starts with "waivio_") for qualified reviews (25).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605662556_f1fc678a-4600-4ddc-9eb0-eb35de3e96ac
Sponsors must use their active keys to confirm payments.
Once the payment is made, it is recorded in the transaction history for that user and the user is removed from the list of outstanding payments (Payables on the sponsor's side and Receivables on the user's side).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605663657_e6638bc7-9249-4296-a6c7-31fd915de0d9
In addition to user rewards, sponsors are also required to pay Processing Fees. The total amount of the Processing Fees is defined by the sponsor at the time the campaign is launched. The minimum amount is 5% of the reward, but the sponsor can specify a higher amount to increase the visibility of their campaign.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605664259_52098c63-09a9-4bc8-8bb2-a98ce889b1f5
Processing fees are shared between three parties:
Campaign Management - this service represents the sponsor's interests by publishing campaigns on the Hive blockchain and checking that users meet the eligibility criteria and reviews meet the requirements;
Reward Indexing - this service represents the interests of the user, it indexes all available rewards and presents the eligible rewards to the user in order to maximize the chances of a successful transaction;
Referral - this is a marketing partner that promotes rewards to new users and brings them to a front-end operated by an indexing service.
Important:
If the sponsor's accounts payable exceed 30 days, all of the sponsor's campaigns will be suspended until the sponsor's obligations are paid.

# How to Launch a Rebate Program for a Restaurant on Waivio
This step-by-step tutorial explains how to launch a rebate program for a restaurant on the Hive social blockchain using Waivio.
All currently active rewards campaigns are shown in the REWARDS (EARN) section on Waivio and other sites that support attention bids. This tutorial focuses on launching a rebate program for a restaurant, but the same approach can be used to offer rewards to users for reviews of other types of products and services.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1604967701_290b9ca9-2a7f-486e-940b-b5b500fa5019
During this tutorial we will be launching a rebate program for the Steveston Seafood House (Richmond, BC) (https://social.gifts/object/gei-steveston-seafood-house/menu#aag-menu) and comparing it to the already operational campaign for the El Furniture House (Whistler, BC) (https://social.gifts/object/wjv-el-furniture-warehouse/menu#svo-menu).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1604971090_c840caec-ea20-44e2-ac80-b75313827c12
Management of rewards is done in the Rewards / Campaigns section:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1604971291_fc406f15-f122-460d-8c71-fb1421ab778e
General Campaign Settings
Click "Create new campaign" button to start the process.
1. Campaign name may appear publicly, but for the most part it is used for internal reporting and references in notifications.
2. Campaign type must be set to Reviews.
3. Monthly campaign budget can be set in US dollars.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1604977397_c143c4ec-907e-4620-ad29-6879690e9cf9
4. Reward. Set the reward per review in U.S. dollars. This amount will be displayed in the reward cards.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1604977711_e13c0664-b115-430d-8fed-6af0c2fa6e13
At the time of reward reservation, the reward amount will be converted to HIVE based on the current exchange rate.
5. Registered upvoting accounts. The reward can be paid as a combination of upvotes (author rewards) and liquid HIVE, but upvote accounts must be clearly declared in the campaign. The value of all other upvotes will not be subtracted from the reward.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1604978236_3f85c713-c4f2-4996-9ae0-81b15dd5d828
6. Compensation account. When guides manage rebate programs for restaurants, they may need to transfer the amount that corresponds to the value of qualified upvotes to another account. The campaign sponsor can specify this compensation account here.
7. Maximum reservation period defines how many days the user will have after reward reservation for completing the review. Please note, that reservations reduce the campaign budget and available funds and it is important to set reasonable expiration dates for reservations. Both the sponsor and the user can cancel the reservation.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1604979237_317c19a0-cbb8-409a-8c7e-aacd3541f018
8. Target days. It is possible to target reviews for specific days of the week. This is achieved by dynamically changing the reservation period. For example, if Friday and Saturday are excluded and a user makes a reservation on Sunday, they will have 5 days to complete the review. But if a user makes a reservation on Thursday, they will only have 1 day to complete their review. On Fridays and Saturdays, this campaign will remain inactive.
Post requirements
When user attempt to reserve the reward, they are informed about all the requirements and other details:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605028473_0dff22c0-3ff2-455e-a7c6-9bb3266be5a8
9. The minimum number of original photos of the secondary object must be specified. At the time of posting, the system will check the number of photos in the review and alert the user if the target number is not reached.
10. Copy of a receipt. It is possible to add the requirement to include a photo of the invoice/receipt or another form of purchase confirmation. If this box is checked, the total number of photos required will be increased by one more.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605026942_85ebf0ae-c0e3-4a7e-be1d-b446caadef39
11. Link to the primary object. Reviews must include at least two links, one link to the primary object and one link to any secondary object. For example, the primary object is the restaurant and the secondary objects are the dishes.
12. Links to secondary objects. It is much easier to copy/paste links to secondary objects instead of searching for them by name, as many dishes have similar names.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605031281_975f7ffb-28fc-48ca-85a3-213989672f6e
13. Additional post requirements may be specified and will be presented to users at the time of writing the review.
Eligibility criteria
Only eligible users may participate in the campaign.
14. Waivio expertise. Users are ranked according to the amount of rewards they have earned on their posts, expressed in Hive Dollars (HBD), and it is possible to specify the minimum Waivio expertise as a condition for participating in the program.
15. Number of followers. It is possible to launch several campaigns with different rewards depending on the number of followers. For example, the $5 is offered to users with minimum requirements, while a separate campaign can be used to target influencers with more than 1,000 followers by offering them $500 for similar reviews.
16. A minimum number of posts may also be used as eligibility criteria.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605034306_49deab14-e6c2-47de-8b84-0ae1aeea8503
17. The eligibility period specifies how often a user can participate in this campaign. In this example, they can participate in the program every 15 days.
Legal
Legal section may include a reference to an agreement which specifies terms and conditions between the sponsor and users.
18. Link to the agreement. The agreement must be published on the Hive blockchain as a page object, which preserves the history of all changes to the document on the public blockchain.
In this example, Pacific Dining Gifts uses an Independent Contractor Agreement, where the sponsor asks users to publish photos of dishes and offers compensation for this work. Please seek the advice of your local legal counsel regarding the terms of such an agreement.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605035753_8e14e1db-259c-4678-98e1-22288f9c9896
19. The legal notice to users may be used to draw users' attention to specific terms of the agreement, such as minimum age or residency requirements.
20. Legal confirmation. This campaign will be administered by Waivio Technologies Inc. and the sponsor must confirm that it agrees to the terms and conditions of the service and that its campaign does not violate any laws of British Columbia, Canada.
21. The campaign expiry date must be specified.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605036636_807a6feb-e0c0-4cf0-9feb-89af11ad4676
22. Commissions to Waivio and partners. In addition to the reward that will be paid to the user, the sponsor must also specify the commissions it offers to all parties that will index, promote and assist users in completing qualified reviews. The minimum commission is 5%, but it can be increased to improve the visibility of the rewards campaign.
Campaign activation
Once the campaign is created, it will appear in the Manage section, but will remain inactive. As long as the campaign is inactive, it can be edited. During the activation of the campaign, its terms and conditions will be published on the Hive blockchain signed by the sponsor. As long as the campaign is active, its terms cannot be changed.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605038290_76bee9a0-5a33-4a83-a18d-fb2117a8384d
The sponsor can deactivate the campaign, but all current user reservations will remain active until their expiration date or until users complete reviews according to the original terms of the campaign. If necessary, the sponsor can cancel active user reservations one by one manually.
Rebates program is now active
Once the campaign is activated, eligible users will be able to see the rewards on the restaurant page (primary object), on all the dishes (secondary objects) and in the Rewards section in the list and on the map.
All the sponsor's followers will receive notifications about the new campaign as well as all users who follow one of the objects referenced in the campaign.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605039198_19c23cc0-7a4f-4c99-8160-ea32da54cc44
Similar campaigns can be launched for all kind of objects and hashtags.
The Waivio platform is being actively developed and new options are constantly being made available to sponsors and users. Please follow our progress on @waivio.
