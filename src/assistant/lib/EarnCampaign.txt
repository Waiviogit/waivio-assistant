The "Terms and Conditions of the Service Agreement" link directs users to [https://waivio.com/object/xrj-terms-and-conditions/page](https://waivio.com/object/xrj-terms-and-conditions/page).
- **Cancel**: A "Cancel" button to cancel the reservation and close the modal window.
- **Submit**: A "Submit Photos" button that, when clicked, redirects to the editor and automatically completes the reservation.
- **Menu**: The three-dots menu includes an option "Reserve the rewards for {number} days," allowing users to reserve the campaign without being redirected to the editor. Clicking this option completes the reservation and redirects to the Reserved tab with the card.

If the user does not meet some reward reservation requirements, then the entire condition will be highlighted in red color to attract attention.

# Reservation modal window if campaign was only reserved, in order to write a review.
The reservation modal window is an interactive interface designed to facilitate user participation in rewards campaigns. After a user reserves a campaign, this modal window presents the requirements, eligibility criteria, and terms associated with the campaign. It provides essential information such as the sponsor's details, reward amount, and legal agreements, ensuring that users understand the conditions before proceeding with their submission. Since the campaign has already been reserved, the option to reserve it is no longer available within this modal.
Here's the revised text with improved clarity while maintaining the original meaning:
**Modal Window Details**
The modal window provides essential information and actions related to the rewards campaign. Here’s a breakdown of its elements:
- **Title**: "We seek honest reviews!" – This message invites users to participate by providing reviews.
- **Button to Close**: A button to close the modal window.
- **Photo Requirement**: "Share {NUMBER} photos of the {objectType} and earn crypto." The number of photos required is displayed at the top of the modal window.
- **Sponsor**: A link to the sponsor's profile.
- **Sponsor Name**: @{sponsorName} – A link to the sponsor's profile.
- **Total Paid**: "Total paid (liquid): {number} WAIV (100%)." This indicates the total amount the sponsor has already paid in rewards for all campaigns.
- **Post Requirements**: To be eligible for the reward, the following must be met:
  - Minimum {number} original photos of {secondaryObject}.
  - A link to {secondaryObject}.
  - A link to {primaryObject}.
  - [Special requirements of the sponsor].
  The sponsor reserves the right to refuse payment if the review is deemed fraudulent, spammy, poorly written, or for any other reasons specified in the agreement.
- **Cancel**: A "Cancel" button to cancel the reservation and close the modal window.
- **Submit**: A "Submit Photos" button that redirects to the editor when clicked.
* After clicking on the button for writing a review, the editor opens where the title "Review: {primaryObject}, {secondaryObject}" is pulled up, and the objects for which the review is written

# Release reservation modal window
The release reservation modal window is used to confirm the cancellation of a reservation. It appears after clicking "Release reservation" in the three-dot menu on the secondary card. Once the reservation is canceled, the campaign becomes available to users again.
- **Title**: "Release reservation" – This indicates the purpose of the modal window.
- **Question**: "Do you want to release this reservation?" – A prompt asking the user to confirm the cancellation.
- **Cancel**: A "Cancel" button to cancel the action and close the modal window.
- **OK**: A button to confirm and proceed with the cancellation of the reservation.

# Waivio updates: April 29, 2020
In order to create a transparent trail of sponsors launching reward campaigns for Hive users, details of these campaigns are now published on the chain (in both .json and easy-to-read text formats) and signed by sponsors as a public declaration of their commitment to pay rewards according to the announced details (426).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1588131710_1012f221-305f-449d-bd9e-b70d054adf80
Rewards campaign
And when Users reserve the reward, they are also posting public records on the blockchain confirming their commitment to write a review (427).
This establishes a legal public record of mutual obligations between Sponsors and Users signed with their posting keys.
Users can cancel their reservations by publishing signed notifications as comments to their original reservations.
It is generally assumed that Sponsors can cancel their Reward Campaigns at any time, but if there are Users who have already reserved the rewards, they should be allowed to complete their work according to the terms that were active at the time of the reservation.
Object status notifications
All users who follow an object or have expertise in the object (earned by referencing, updating or curating it) are notified of critical Status changes (unavailable, relisted, NSFW, flagged) that affect the visibility of the object throughout the system (381).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1588127637_952ae774-f3f6-4e59-8de6-02b994a15896
Object status notifications
In this example @diningguide has created a "Test restaurant" object. And when @wiaviolabs changed the status of this restaurant listing to " Unavailable", @diningguide received a notification with the option to Reject this action.

# Waivio update: May 25, 2020
There are many parties involved in the processing of each reward, in addition to the eligible user (who has completed the task) and the sponsor (who pays the reward), such as campaign posting, rewards indexing and referral services, as well as additional beneficiaries, specified by the user at the time of posting.
Waivio now offers a detailed report of all the parties involved, their roles and their share of rewards.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1590445655_1d078090-f306-40d8-a5b8-87100792501d
In this example:
@pacific.gifts (sponsor) announced the reward of 15 HIVE for 2 original photos of the Meat Platter for Two from Kisamos Greek Taverna (Richmond, BC, Canada).
User @foomoo reserved the reward (met all of the eligibility requirements: minimum expertise, # of followers, # of posts, etc.) and
posted a qualifying review (2+ photos, links to the dish and the restaurant).
The first table provides a summary of User rewards and their distribution among all beneficiaries specified in the post. In this example, @waivio is listed as a 3% beneficiary (the qualifying review was posted using Waivio.com).
The second table shows the distribution of Processing fees (sponsor offered 5% on top of user rewards to all the parties for hosting, indexing and processing of rewards).
Three parties are involved in the processing of rewards in a decentralized environment:
Campaign management (posting attention bids on the blockchain);
Rewards indexing (personalizing attention bids for users according to their eligibility and preferences);
Referral (external marketing partners, who receive credit for bringing new users to the platform).
The HIVE/USD exchange rate is recorded at the time of reward reservation. It is important for transparent reporting, including for tax purposes (e.g. capital gains).
In the current example, all services are operated by Waivio (waivio posting service, waivio.camaigns, waivio.index, waivio.referrals). In a decentralized environment each service could be operated by a different party.
Post beneficiaries
Users can now specify multiple beneficiaries for author rewards in their posts (advanced settings in the post preview):

# How To Manage Rebates and Payments On Waivio
This tutorial focuses on managing rewards and payments for active campaigns. We will look at the process from both user and sponsor perspectives.
Users can reserve rewards for a few days (as indicated on the reward card) and be assured that the offer will not disappear when they are ready to submit the review.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605647737_01988c1a-bdc9-4267-b2c5-d7462d9729b6
When the user makes a reservation, the sponsor receives a notification. The sponsor can view the status of all reservations in Campaign/Reservations, and can filter them by status (reservered, completed, expired, etc.) and campaigns (1).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605647782_be0bc881-0b38-4de2-9a26-a1ba00766429
At this point, the sponsor can view the reservation, release it or even increase the reward for that specific reservation (2).
Users can view a list of all active reservations in Rewards/Reservations (3), check the number of days remaining, release reservations they no longer intend to complete or start to write the review (5).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605651694_98169f4e-998e-4674-a8d7-fef87208ed55
Completed and expired reservations will be removed from Rewards/Reservations, but can still be viewed in Rewards/History (4).
In order for a review to be eligible for the reward, certain criteria must be met. For this campaign, the post must have at least two original photos of the dish and links to the dish and the restaurant. When the user begins the review writing process, the links are already pre-filled in the review draft (6).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605651995_6cbd5140-d057-4e0b-b1f4-e84e77790716
And when the user adds photos (7) and some text, the review is ready to be published. Users can add additional tags (8) and object links for better discovery of their post.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605652599_9f445ccc-8b7a-4201-87b8-6a3cfe978833
Once the review is published, it will appear in the user's profile, on the linked pages of the restaurant, dish and hashtags. It will also appear in the news feeds of other users who follow this user or one of the objects mentioned in this review (10).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605653041_0b21f1a4-7153-49aa-806b-d00ff994504d
At the same time, the sponsor will also receive a notification (11), informing them that a qualified review has been published and the status of this reservation will change to "Completed" (12).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605653364_c88a401b-5025-4d68-b1ba-2275610db8c3
The sponsor can now open the review, examine the detailed report and, if he or she suspects that the submission is fraudulent, reject it or even blacklist the user, making them ineligible to participate in any future campaigns of that sponsor (13).
While the sponsor is examining the review, the user can open Rewards/Receivables (14) to see a list of all sponsors who currently owe payments to them.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605653736_eeb072d5-4983-440a-a694-03b332b89112
In this example, there is only one such account and the user can click on the link to view the rewards and payments history (15).
For each eligible submission, additional information is provided (16), including links to the review, linked objects and the beneficiaries of the author rewards. Please note that awards will be distributed to all beneficiaries based on the percentages stated in the post.
In this example, 97% of the rewards will go to the author, while 3% will be paid to the application (Waivio) that was used to submit the review. The list of beneficiaries and their shares can be edited at the post preview stage (9 - Advanced settings).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605654988_933179c6-1d03-4375-bcf1-2167f4f77cf4
We will examine the detailed report for an older review (17), because it already includes the values for all upvotes.
Rewards are stated in USD, but are paid in HIVE (18). The exact amount of HIVE is calculated at the time of reservation based on the current exchange rate (19).
The reward will be paid in the form of a combination of upvotes (Hive Power - 20) and direct payments (liquid HIVE - 21). Only upvotes from registered accounts (22) count towards the payment of rewards. The value of all other upvotes is not subtracted from the specified amount of the reward.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605661422_8efca8a2-83cb-41bf-b65e-7304caae3bcf
And the outstanding amount in the liquid HIVE (23) is what the sponsor is supposed to pay the user for this review.
Sponsors can use Campaigns/Payables (24) to quickly distribute funds to users, including guests (name starts with "waivio_") for qualified reviews (25).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605662556_f1fc678a-4600-4ddc-9eb0-eb35de3e96ac
Sponsors must use their active keys to confirm payments.
Once the payment is made, it is recorded in the transaction history for that user and the user is removed from the list of outstanding payments (Payables on the sponsor's side and Receivables on the user's side).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605663657_e6638bc7-9249-4296-a6c7-31fd915de0d9
In addition to user rewards, sponsors are also required to pay Processing Fees. The total amount of the Processing Fees is defined by the sponsor at the time the campaign is launched. The minimum amount is 5% of the reward, but the sponsor can specify a higher amount to increase the visibility of their campaign.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605664259_52098c63-09a9-4bc8-8bb2-a98ce889b1f5
Processing fees are shared between three parties:
Campaign Management - this service represents the sponsor's interests by publishing campaigns on the Hive blockchain and checking that users meet the eligibility criteria and reviews meet the requirements;
Reward Indexing - this service represents the interests of the user, it indexes all available rewards and presents the eligible rewards to the user in order to maximize the chances of a successful transaction;
Referral - this is a marketing partner that promotes rewards to new users and brings them to a front-end operated by an indexing service.
Important:
If the sponsor's accounts payable exceed 30 days, all of the sponsor's campaigns will be suspended until the sponsor's obligations are paid.

![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1595919807_7492ede3-6951-4a74-8172-d633655b3c4d
In order for the post to qualify for the reward, it must have 2 or more orignial photos and include links both to Hive 5 and My Favorite Coffee Mug objects. Both links will be included in the initial draft of the post when you press the "Write review" button.
You don't need to know markup language to use the Waivio editor:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1595917310_b514593d-17ec-482b-a67c-3880269a44ca
Once you have submitted the qualifying post, you can track the payment progress and access a detailed report using Rewards/Receivables .
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1595926846_ebcc37d1-e246-4482-9049-8c14826b68d5
Rewards are paid as a combination of upvotes (Hive Power) and liquid HIVE. Only upvotes from registered accounts (@vancouverdining and @waivio.match) will be counted towards the payment of rewards. Value of all other upvotes is not substracted from the announced reward.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1595926876_6e3682fa-d44b-4ecd-b3a2-107294df8116
If the post has multiple beneficiaries, all rewards will be distributed accordingly.
Disclaimer:
The Waivio platform is new and the attention trading process is very complex and uses many independent services. All of these parts should work well so that the whole process is simple and flawless. We hope that with time and the help of the community we will achieve the best possible user experience.
This post serves both as the announcement of the campaign and as a qualified post for the reward:
This is My Favorite Coffee Mug, a souvenir from the Yellowstone National Park. As you can see, this one has been around for a while ;-)

This is a mug, not an espresso shot. It was designed to keep you warm and cozy while contemplating about the profound meaning of the artwork and the beauty of life...
