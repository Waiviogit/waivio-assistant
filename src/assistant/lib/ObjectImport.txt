Part 1: Extension Setup

Before adding products with extensions, you need to set up a few things:
1. Add extension
The first thing you will need to do is add the extension to your browser.
Sign to Waivio. Head to "Tools", and under Data Management – click on "Chrome Extension". Download the .zip file, and once it's downloaded, unzip it. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1698078245_9d6d5daf-7bbd-4952-94a6-7d2acb639f2a)
Next, open your browser (any Chromium-based one like Google Chrome, Brave, or Edge). Here is shown the setup with Chrome, as it's a more popular browser, but the setup will be very similar on other browsers as well.
Go to (1) Settings -> (2) Extensions -> (3) Enable the "Developer mode" ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1698078300_4e2c853f-b3bc-4b14-8fce-5a1e8c822a2a)
(4) Click "Load unpacked" -> (5) and choose the unzipped folder that we've downloaded -> (6) Click "Select" ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1698078296_4d9768d4-dccc-4bdf-8545-a3d798740d1d)
Pin the extension to keep it visible in your browser. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1698078283_6c22b522-2c3d-4bd1-ac45-4070c740eab4)

2. Authorization
Next, in a new tab, open Waivio, sign in if you haven't already, go to "Tools", and under "Data Management", click on "Data Import".
Here give authorization to the import bot by clicking "Authorize now", and then "Authorize". You only need to do this once. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1698079791_f3c93801-16b1-4333-b1a6-e4babdafd777)

3. Check the Funds
Finally, ensure that you have both WAIV Power and HIVE Power, as each update requires an upvote equivalent to $0.001. You can find more information about these requirements in Step 3 of the tutorial, How to Import Products on Hive https://www.waivio.com/object/kda-waivio-chrome-extension-tutorial/page#uiy-how-to-import-products-on-hive.
Now our setup is complete.

Part 2: "Upload to Waivio" - Import products in One Click
Open the product you want on Amazon, click on the extension and click "Upload to Waivio".
If a notification pops up asking you to use a different URL format, simply click "Ok". The page will then automatically reload with the new URL format. This step might be necessary to display the departments related to that product.
Click, "Upload to Wavio", one more time – and you should see the notification "Import successfully started by, and your username." ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1698078648_82c2dac5-14a8-46f4-8c97-0a831babb4c8)
You can check the import progress in "Data Import". Once it's done – you can review the product page and edit it if necessary. The imported products will automatically appear in the shop in your profile. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1698079055_14dac9c6-5f89-485d-85f9-3bdea39f7460)
 If you're importing multiple products, it's advisable to save the ASIN numbers for each product. This practice will simplify the process of adding them to custom lists at a later stage. Product lists featuring custom avatars can significantly enhance the user experience on social shopping websites.

Part 3: Adding Reviews
You can further enhance product pages by adding video reviews where people demonstrate how to use the product or compare it to similar ones. YouTube users often encourage the sharing of their videos on other websites.
The Waivio extension simplifies the process of adding shareable YouTube video reviews to product pages on Hive.
Let's open the product we just imported in a new tab.
Click on "Reviews" -> and "Write a new review".
Let's search this product on YouTube. If you find a video review for your product – click on the extension "Create Post Draft". This will generate a post draft based on the video using chatGPT. It will include a title, a short summary, and hashtags. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1698079009_e5fbe288-45b1-4316-a3ad-71e4108cacfc)
You can copy the post draft – and paste it into your review post.
You can make some quick changes to improve the post:
- Use the generated video title as the post title
- Use the plus button to insert the youtube video – this way it will be better integrated into your post
- Check the hashtags - you may want to simplify some lengthy hashtags or add other relevant hashtags to make your post more discoverable.
When you are ready, click "Ready to Publish", then "Publish”.
Now the product will be supplemented with video reviews, further assisting potential buyers in understanding the product better.

Part 4: Advanced Import
For advanced users who import products in bulk, the extension offers additional helpful features. Let's explore them:
1. "Scan for ASINS"
If you want to get ASINs of multiple products from Amazon, you can use the "Scan for ASINS" feature.
Simply search for a specific product category, like, "baby onesies". Then you can sort by "Average customer review" or "Bestselling", to get top-rated products on the first page. Click "Scan for ASINS" – a text file will be generated – save it. The text file will list all the ASINS numbers found on that Amazon page except those already present on the Hive blockchain. The extension filters out products that are already available on Hive to prevent duplication. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1698079095_d8b46591-4eec-49f0-b52b-07068fc5715e)
You can repeat this process for the ASINs on Amazon's second page and so on.
Similarly, you can get product ASINs for products in broader categories. For example, if you choose "Best Sellers" and then "Best Sellers in Home," you'll get the ASINs of the best-selling products in the Home category.
Next, you can use Datafinity to generate a JSON file and import the products in bulk onto the Hive blockchain – to learn more about the import process with Datafinity, check out How to Import Products on Hive https://www.waivio.com/object/kda-waivio-chrome-extension-tutorial/page#uiy-how-to-import-products-on-hive.
Go to Product Data -> API -> copy the ASINS from the text file and paste it in the field -> click "Download" -> Choose "JSON" as the format -> "Confirm Download". Once the file is prepared – click "Download All".
You can upload this file – in the "Data Import" section in Waivio.
Please note that some items from the ASIN list might be missing from the Datafinity database, but you can search these products on Amazon by their ASIN number and easily import them with the "Upload to Waivio" feature.

2. Create XLXS
If you prefer working with a spreadsheet for adding products, you can use "Create XLXS" to generate a new spreadsheet with all the fields filled about the product. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1698079212_01146b58-ba83-40d2-be67-3f2a15834345)
To learn how to import products from a spreadsheet, see the tutorial How to Export Products from Spreadsheet https://www.waivio.com/object/kda-waivio-chrome-extension-tutorial/page#ehd-how-to-export-products-from-spreadsheet.

3. Copy to clipboard
If you already have a spreadsheet and just want to copy the information about this specific product, use the "Copy to Clipboard" feature. Paste it into your Excel or Google Docs file. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1698079238_a382cb23-262e-43f5-9cfd-b8a5fc2a3a0b)
From Google Docs, you can easily create a JSON file, which can then be imported into the Data Import section in Waivio. This is explained in more detail in How to Export Products from Spreadsheet tutorial https://www.waivio.com/object/kda-waivio-chrome-extension-tutorial/page#ehd-how-to-export-products-from-spreadsheet.

4. Create JSON
Finally, the "Create JSON" feature enables you to create a JSON file for an Amazon product. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1698079256_26a2996c-1761-434f-9b44-2bd32a44be51)
You can import this JSON file in the "Data Import" section in Waivio.
Part 4. The new version of the extension
As the Waivio Chrome extension evolves, newer versions may become available. You can easily download these updates in the Chrome extension section. I recommend disabling or removing the previous version from the browser before adding the new one to avoid any conflicts.

Final Remarks 😉
With the Waivio Chrome extension, adding products and reviews to the Hive blockchain becomes a seamless and efficient process. Whether you are managing a small online shop or dealing with a large number of imports, this extension provides valuable tools to enhance your experience on the Hive blockchain. Enjoy building your social shops!


# Lesson 8: Importing Products from Datafiniti
For more details give a link to https://www.waivio.com/object/uiy-how-to-import-products-on-hive/page
Adding products to the blockchain manually can be time-consuming, especially if you need to add multiple items. Luckily, Waivio offers a data import feature that allows you to import many products all at once. Waivio supports import in JSON format (see the supported format here: https://developer.datafiniti.co/docs/product-data-schema)
This format is used by Datafinity, which is one of the largest databases with hundreds of millions of products that are regularly updated.
And in this tutorial, I will show you how to use Datafinity to find and export product information in the JSON format. You can also use any other service that allows data export in the compatible format. In the next tutorial, I will also show you how to use your own spreadsheet to export your product data in this format.

Authority Level: https://www.waivio.com/object/uiy-how-to-import-products-on-hive/page#tmu-business-3-0/mqk-dining-gifts/vjf-create-your-dining-gifts-business
Let's dive in

Step 1: Find and export your product with Datafinity
To find your product on Datafinity, click on the "Product" tab and use filters to search for your product. As an example, I will be using a yoga block that comes in many colors.
If you're looking for a specific product, the easiest way to find it is by using its ASIN number. You can find the ASIN number under additional information on the Amazon page of the respective product.
Copy the ASIN number, paste it into the Datafinity "asins filter", and click "Search". Datafinity will display all the matching product records. It may have multiple records for the same product. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1681417996_c3e23a31-aa8f-4dcf-87de-46a9f133e5ba)
To download the file, click on "Download", and simply choose JSON as the format. In the "Number of Records" field, enter the same number as the "Total matching records". If there are multiple records for the same product, Waivio will handle them and extract only the relevant information.
If our product comes in other colors - we can download all the variant products at once. To do this: switch to the JSON view for the product we found and use the browser's find function (Ctrl+F on Windows or Command+F on Mac) to search for "parent ASIN". Copy this value. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1681419861_25129663-e764-4c64-9877-537da14211cc)
Then go to "Add Filter", select "Features", and then choose "value". Paste the parent ASIN that we found, and click "Search". Datafinity will now display all the product variants in different colors. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1681419870_8d5e9caa-8432-4346-8d31-ef3ae6607a72)
Click on "Download", again select the JSON format, enter the total number of records, and confirm the download. Save the JSON file on your computer. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1681417887_e002eb80-d640-4d64-be23-706e0589dddd)

Step 2: Authorize data import on Waivio
Now we can go to Waivio. Navigate to "Tools". Under "Data Management", click on "Data Import". ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1681417719_e0219639-4fa1-4cd0-ad72-11db3f6b9916)
You will need to authorize a bot to make upvotes on your behalf for the product updates. To do that click on "Authorize Now" and follow the steps to authorize the bot. You will always be able to revoke the authorization at any time.

Step 3. Ensure you have enough WAIV and Hive power
Next, you will need to ensure that you have enough WAIV and HIVE power

WAIV Power
When you import products on Hive, each piece of information, such as the product description, product ID, and avatar, will be added as a separate update. The bot will take care of creating all these updates and upvoting them for you. Each upvote is equivalent to $0.001 in WAIV power.
Therefore, you will need enough WAIV power to perform this action on the blockchain. For example, if I go to my wallet, I have WAIV Power tokens with a value of approximately $440, this gives me Waiv power of $0.01. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1681417613_8880a4bd-1d90-4e10-9813-50009da1df49)
It may seem that I have enough only for ten updates, but this is not correct - I actually have enough for hundreds of updates. Let me show you the math:
When I give a full upvote, I only use 2% of my vote power; to give a tiny upvote worth $0.001 with my vote power of $0.01, I just need to use 10% of a full upvote ($0.001/$0.01 x 100% = 10%).
Every time I make the upvote equivalent to $0.001, my vote power will just drop by a fraction of a percent. After one update, my vote power will drop by 0.2% and result in a new vote power of $0.00998, even after 100 updates, my vote power will still be high - $0.008. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1681417312_6df738bf-c4cc-485f-bfa0-ba9c94db9959)
You can set up your threshold beyond which you don’t want your vote power to drop. By default, the voting power threshold is set to 30%, meaning that import will stop when your voting power is below 30%. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1681417839_33fb946e-430f-4cc1-ac42-3264440b346b)
Your voting power recharges every day by 20%, so with this threshold, it will take around four days to restore your power.
The absolute minimum is when your vote power reaches $0.001; with this vote power you can no longer make $0.001 upvotes.

HIVE Power
In addition to Waiv Power, you'll also need to have enough Resource Credits (RC). HIVE Resource Credits are credits given to your account based on how much HivePower you have, and they are used up whenever you record something on the blockchain, such as upvotes, posts, and comments. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1681417146_825915d9-7b6d-4a5b-b90c-b551b2166879)
During the import, the bot will create product updates and upvote them for you, but you still need to have enough resource credits so that the bot can record these upvotes on the blockchain. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1681417118_62763b12-ceaa-4edd-a798-4681044ced80)
The bot is designed to use as few RC as possible. Without the bot, you would need significantly more credits to add a product.
If your RC falls below 10%, the import process will slow down. To be safe, I would recommend to have a ratio of approximately 4:1 (400 Waiv Power to 100 Hive Power).
By the way, by importing products, you are not losing any WAIV or HIVE tokens; it’s actually the opposite; you will gain WAIV tokens from the upvotes on the product’s updates.

Step 4: Upload the JSON file
Now we can proceed to the import. Click on "Upload New File". Select (1)"product". Upload the (2) JSON file you downloaded from Datafinity. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1681419910_b8211550-d535-493b-9e40-a9df51628d35)
The product description on Amazon may not always be great, so you can check the box next to "optimize description with chatGPT". This will rewrite the product's description with the help of chatGPT.
Next, you need to choose the appropriate (3) authority level (Ownership or Administrative). If you will be curating the product and don't want anyone else to add any information to the product, I recommend choosing ownership; otherwise, choose administrative (check this tutorial).
Click "Confirm" when you are done.

Step 5: Import
Once you've uploaded the JSON file, the import process will start automatically. You will see the information about your import, such as the number of objects that you are importing, the total number of updates that will be required, and how many updates and objects have already been posted. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1681419271_11c45394-ffe1-475a-aa6c-2a7cdd513764)
*Remember to reload the page to see the progress.
If the import stops, it's likely because you've reached your WAIV power threshold or used all the HIVE resource credits. But don't worry, the import process will resume once your power gets recharged. You can also pause the import process yourself by unchecking the "active" box.
If you are importing many JSON files, you can prioritize certain objects by leaving only the priority items active. This will help you to import priority items first.

Step 6: Check the published products
Once the import is complete, your products will be published on Hive blockchain and you can search them on Waivio. It's always a good idea to double-check the product page to make sure all the information is accurate and complete. If you notice something is missing, you can easily add it manually (see the tutorial here https://www.waivio.com/object/uiy-how-to-import-products-on-hive/page#tmu-business-3-0/uxp-social-gifts/gyg-how-to-add-a-product-to-hive).
Now, we have successfully imported multiple products to the Hive Blockchain with Waivio. This method saves you time and effort, and you can import hundreds of products easily. Now that you know how to use this import feature on Waivio, you can take your business to the next level by adding more products to the blockchain. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1681416913_12aaa55d-214f-4aac-9541-38ee2256a204)

 Recommendation
 - Use Google account when you don't have important files - because, every time when script is running, a file is created on your Google Drive. So from time to time you will need to clear the space. (Script running after you click "Export JSON for this sheet").
 - In order to successfully import objects such as a book and a restaurant, the relevant department must be in the list of categories (Books, Restaurant).
 - Do not use ";" as a value in the field, if its categories, colors, features, sizes, waivio_tags because it is a separator for these fields. Use only as separator.
 - Do not use "*" as a value in the field, if its features, waivio_tags because it is a separator for these fields. Use only as separator.
 - Don't change field names in first row, because there are correct field names.
 - Don't change field order and don't delete columns, because the script is guided by the location index.
 - It is not necessary to fill in all cells. Empty cells will be skipped.

# Introducing the Claim Authority Tool
Website owners on *.Social.Gifts have full control over product searches on their individual websites. Search results include only the objects specifically claimed by the website owner or approved authorities.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1691448303_488afaa7-0806-4bb4-9e15-ea4de1060551
If a team of admins is actively adding products to various lists throughout the website, these products won't appear in search results until they have been properly claimed by the owner. Simply adding all admins as authorities won't solve this issue, as admins might be involved in multiple projects. Including all of their products in search results could lead to a clutter of irrelevant products appearing.
For small numbers of products, website owners can claim each product one-by-one. However, this approach becomes challenging when dealing with a large number of products.
Introducing the Claim Authority Tool

# Descriptions Bot for Unique Product Descriptions
A common issue with publishing product information on multiple websites from the same record on the open Hive blockchain is that this content will be exactly the same across various sites, and search engines generally do not favor duplicated content. Waivio uses a system of canonical links on all hosted sites, giving credit to the original source of content, whether it's a user post, profile, or an object.
However, there is now an interesting alternative.
Introducing Descriptions Bot
One product on the Hive blockchain can actually have multiple names, titles, descriptions, and other fields. In the case of an image gallery, it may show multiple images at the same time, while for a description field, only one version will be used—the one that collected the most Approve votes. This will be the version of the description that appears on Waivio and other hosted websites.
However, the website owner's vote holds decisive power within the information space of their own website. If the owner approves a different version of the product description, that version will be displayed on their website, even if another description was selected as the overall winner in the general consensus.
This means the same product can be presented differently on Waivio and the hosted site, making it possible to present to users and search engines unique versions of the same product.
Descriptions Bot can automatically rewrite descriptions for all products referenced in a chain of lists, starting from the top list and including all other embedded lists. Descriptions Bot uses ChatGPT to rewrite names and descriptions of all the products, as well as titles and descriptions of all the lists themselves. This way, you can effortlessly ensure that your website presents unique content for indexing by search engines.

To initiate the Descriptions Bot, open Tools (1) and select Descriptions Bot (2) in the Data Management section. If this is the first time you are using Descriptions Bot, you will need to authorize it (3). Once authorized, you can click on Rewrite Descriptions (4), specify the list, and begin the process.

Please note that each update (revised description, title, or name) requires a minimum upvote of at least $0.01 value in WAIV tokens. You can specify the minimum voting power (30% is the default value). Once the VP on your account falls below that value, or if the voting power is below $0.01, the process will slow down, waiting for the voting power to restore (it automatically restores at the rate of 20% per day).
You may launch this bot for multiple lists simultaneously. Progress will be monitored in a table. Jobs can be paused or resumed at any moment by changing the job status in the 'Active' column. Completed jobs will then be transferred to the history table.
Descriptions Bot allows website owners to effortlessly improve their search engine rankings with original content, making their site content more discoverable in search engines.
