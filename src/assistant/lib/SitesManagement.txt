# Tools / Site / Affiliate codes
The **Affiliate Codes** (website) page allows users to enter and manage their affiliate codes for the website. These codes enable users to earn commissions from affiliate programs such as Amazon, Walmart, and others by automatically integrating them into 'Buy Now' links across the site’s product listings.
![image](https://github.com/Waiviogit/waivio/assets/67378322/9a7154ec-897b-444c-a59b-05f26778330b)

### Element description in Affiliate codes (website) page
Title: Affiliate codes for {site}
Text: Enter your affiliate program codes from various platforms, including Amazon.com, Walmart.com, and others. These codes will be automatically integrated into the 'Buy Now' links across your website's product listings. This ensures you earn affiliate commissions from all sales initiated by your website visitors. Take advantage of the geo-targeting feature by entering affiliate codes for location-specific shops, such as Amazon.ca, Amazon.co.uk, and more. These codes will direct traffic based on the geographical location of your website visitors, thereby maximizing your potential affiliate revenues.
For a seamless and uninterrupted user experience, we also recommend checking and confirming the Product IDs on your products.
Find: "Find affiliate program"
Find field: search field by affiliate programs object type.
Codes title: "Affiliate codes:"
Codes list: list of affiliate programs that user added. Affiliate card include name, code and Delete button. If a user deletes an affiliate code and then re-adds the same code, our system will recognize this action. Instead of creating a new update, we will automatically validate and update the existing code, adding approve vote.

**Affiliate Code Features:**
- If a user has not provided a region-specific affiliate code, the system will default to the next available code in the country-region-global hierarchy. Button links for the missing region will redirect to the code that is set.
- If a user deletes a site, the corresponding affiliate code will be invalidated. However, if the user re-adds the same site with the same affiliate code, the system will automatically approve the code to make it active again.
- When an affiliate code is updated via the **Affiliate Codes** page (for both users and sites), it will automatically receive a 1% approval vote.
- If a user owns a store but hasn’t provided personal affiliate codes, the system will insert the website’s default affiliate codes on the **social.gifts** sites.


# Tools / Site / Administrators
Hive is a public blockchain where any user can publish updates to objects. These updates are then subject to community voting for approval or rejection. However, on individual websites, there may be a need for certain objects to appear in a specific way as defined by the site operators.
To manage this, the website owner can assign administrative privileges to certain Hive users, giving them the authority to govern the appearance and updates of objects. Administrators play a key role in deciding which updates to approve or reject.
![Administrator Management UI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42100432/93951599-a4cb5000-fcfb-11ea-8414-5c95ada36549.png)
### Administrator Voting and Object Ownership:
- **Voting Power**: Administrators have the final say in whether an update is accepted or rejected for the site. If several administrators vote on the same update, only the last vote is considered.
- **Object Ownership**: If an administrator claims ownership over an object, only the updates that are explicitly approved by that administrator (or other approved administrators) will be displayed for the object.
### Managing Administrators:
In **Administrators Mode**, the website owner can add or remove administrators as needed. The process for managing the administrator list is similar to managing a blacklist.
1. **Grant Administrative Privileges**:
   - Use the "Find User" field to search for and select a Hive user to assign as an administrator.
   - The "Add" button will become active once a user is selected.
2. **List of Website Administrators**:
   - The **Administrator List** displays all users who have been assigned administrative privileges.
   - Each entry includes a delete button, allowing the removal of an administrator if necessary.


# Tools / Site / Moderators
Some content published on the Hive blockchain may conflict with local laws or company policies. To ensure that such content does not appear on your website, the site owner can appoint moderators.
![Moderator Management UI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67378322/141975953-fb4f53c6-6c48-4c1b-87b8-8f541b02857b.png)
### Moderator Roles:
- **Hide Content**: If a moderator flags a post or comment as inappropriate, that content will be removed from the site.
- **Mute Users**: If a moderator mutes a user, none of the content from that user will be displayed on the site.
### Managing Moderators:
The process for managing moderators is similar to managing blacklists.
1. **Grant Moderator Privileges**:
   - Use the "Find User" field to search for and select a Hive user to assign as a moderator.
   - The "Add" button will become active once a user is selected.
2. **List of Website Moderators**:
   - The **Website Moderators** section displays all users who have been granted moderator privileges.
   - Each entry includes a delete button, allowing the removal of a moderator if necessary.
Website Moderators Page Text: Some of the content on the Hive blockchain may violate local laws or company policies and it is essential that such content does not appear on the website. The website owner may grant moderator privileges to some Hive users. If a moderator flags a post or comment, that content will not appear on the website. If a moderator mute a user, none of that user's content will be displayed on the website.


# Tools / Site / Authorities
The **Authorities page** is a management interface where website owners can assign and oversee trusted users (authorities) who are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of object data on the site. It provides tools to:
- Add Hive users as **trusted authorities**, allowing them to approve or reject updates to specific objects.
- View and manage the list of authorities, ensuring that only approved updates from trusted users are displayed.
- Assign **ownership authority**, which limits object updates to those explicitly approved by the designated authority.
The page also allows site administrators to override authority votes, ensuring key decisions like affiliate link updates align with site goals.
Authority Roles:
- Claiming Authority: Any user can claim authority over an entity, enabling them to monitor and approve updates for accuracy.
- Trusted Authorities: The website owner can specify which authorities are trusted, ensuring that only updates approved by these users are applied to the site.
- Administrator Override: The votes of site administrators take precedence over authorities, allowing website operators to make key decisions like including affiliate codes on product links.
This mechanism can help ensure that object descriptions remain accurate while allowing controlled lists of objects to be added to the website.
For instance, a manufacturer can oversee the accuracy of their product descriptions, and a website can automatically add the manufacturer’s products to its catalog by including them in the trusted authority list.
Managing Authorities:
1. Add Authorities:
  - Use the "Find User" field to search for and add a user as a trusted authority.
  - The "Add" button will be enabled once a user is selected.
2. List of Trusted Authorities: Displays all users assigned as trusted authorities for the website. Each entry includes a delete button to remove a user from the list if needed.
Page main text: Any Hive user can declare that they are responsible for the accuracy of an object by claiming authority over it. They exercise their authority by approving or rejecting object updates. If full ownership authority has been claimed, then user assumes that only approved updates will be processed. The website owner can specify which authorities to trust (claims of other users will be ignored). This mechanism can be used to add controlled lists of objects to the website, while ensuring their accuracy.
![2021-11-16_13-27_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67378322/141977369-7b88e72a-85b5-4754-a91a-a7cd4eba2544.png)


# Tools / Site / Muted users
The **Muted Users page** is a management tool where website owners can monitor and control user privileges. It is divided into two tabs: **Muted** and **Blacklisted**, each serving a distinct function for user moderation.
Both tabs allow website owners to maintain control over user content and ensure that moderation aligns with site policies.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7aac475-fcbf-4bb8-8c94-0e5551e4719f)

### Muted Tab in Muted users
The **Muted** section displays a list of users who have been muted by website moderators or the site owner. Muted users' posts, comments, and profile information are hidden from the website. Website owners can mute users, but only the moderator who applied the mute can unmute them. If the site owner muted the user, they have the ability to unmute them.
Moderators can mute users and admins can add them to blacklists and even link to other users and their blacklists. In such a situation, it is important for the site owner to understand why the privileges of a particular user are suspended and by whom. In the case of blacklists, the site owner can restore the user's privileges to edit objects by adding him to his whitelist.
In the Muted section, all users who are muted by any moderator are collected in one list. The site owner can also mute users and on such users he sees the Unmute button. For everyone else - just a link to the moderator/ s who muted this user.
If the user is muted, then his posts and comments are not shown, and only his username is shown on the profile page. This mode can be used to partially satisfy the "right to be forgotten" when the user requires the site owner to keep information about him unavailable.
![Muted users page image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67378322/141988499-ac1f0d58-1420-4c08-bf73-523e75b643ce.png)
- **Features**:
  - Shows a list of all muted users, with a link to the moderator(s) responsible for muting each user.
  - Muted users only have their username displayed on their profile.
  - The list can be sorted by rank or recency of the mute action.
- **Text**: Website moderators can mute users. Posts, comments, and the profile content of muted users are not accessible on the website. The website owner can also mute users, but only the moderator who has muted a user can unmute them.

### Blacklisted Tab in Muted users
The **Blacklisted** section allows website administrators to blacklist users, which prevents any updates or votes from those users from being counted. Administrators can manage the blacklist and whitelist through the Rewards section, allowing for control over which users' contributions are ignored or restored.
![2021-11-16_14-32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67378322/141988498-8b185bf1-17da-45cb-a388-9fea2338e480.png)
- **Features**:
  - Displays a list of blacklisted users, sourced from the Rewards section.
  - Administrators can override blacklists by adding users to a whitelist, restoring their privileges.
- **Text**: Website administrators can add users to blacklists. All object updates and votes on updates from blacklisted users are ignored. The website owner can also add users to their blacklist. They can also add users to their whitelist to override any other blacklist.
If the administrator added someone to the blacklist, then all updates initiated by this user and votes for updates are no longer counted. Only those updates remain for which there are other votes. In fact, all of this user's contribution to the creation and enhancement of objects should be ignored. Administrators do not have access to site configuration and they use a standard tool - (campaigns) blacklist.


# Tools / Site / AdSense ads
The **AdSense Advertisements** page is a user interface designed to help website owners integrate Google AdSense ads into their website. This ensures ads are displayed across all pages of the site, providing a consistent and seamless ad experience for visitors.

# Lesson 10: Introduction to Social Shopping on Web 3
 For more details give a link to https://www.waivio.com/object/tso-social-shopping-on-hive/page

 Consider this: how much of what you know, your experience and expertise could be a goldmine for someone else?
 But how, you might wonder, can you showcase all that you've learned and discovered?

 Social Shopping

 Picture this: you come across a product you like, mark it with a “heart”, and it's added to your profile shop – much like creating a shopping wishlist.wishlist. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1692042555_9b9ddeb1-6e93-41e0-a548-fb52b0c4e2de)

 Dedicated Social.Gifts Website
 If you believe your expertise deserves a broader audience, consider elevating your shop and launching a dedicated Social.Gifts website. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1692042615_0c5c1988-27fd-43e9-96ed-15d7b7be6872)
 It provides an outstanding user experience, can be adapted to your unique branding, and comes with a wide range of features: from captivating product catalogs and custom newsfeeds to efficient product searches and seamless integration of forms, calendars, and various widgets.
 Here are some examples:
 Clean Girl Aesthetics: https://cleangirl.social.gifts/
 Camping Checklist: https://camping.social.gifts
 Coffee Time: https://coffeetime.social.gifts
 For website owners, revenue opportunities go beyond affiliate earnings. They also include advertising revenue and commissions from both author and sponsored rewards gathered by website users. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1692042648_750f0dc8-8347-4919-b6cf-34c37c966aab)

 Decentralization and Web 3.0
 In the Web 2.0 era, every online shop functions like an isolated island. With each one building its own user database, creating its own product knowledge base, and collecting product reviews from ground zero. This siloed approach results in redundant efforts, as data remains trapped within the confines of each project. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1692042672_a22aeca9-9738-4f17-b847-8f4951b102ef)
 In Web 3.0, content isn't merely published on an open, decentralized blockchain—it's liberated! ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1692042699_61264e6b-003f-4444-945d-9628079a2f78)
 Imagine a product manufacturer publishing detailed information about their items on the Hive open blockchain. Any shop wishing to feature these products can simply mark them with a "heart" . What's more, when the manufacturer updates their products, these changes are effortlessly reflected across all the shops. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1692042723_f627cb09-f456-4ec5-9044-4f6f580f134e)
 Managing large collections of third-party products becomes so simple!
 That's not all! Hive operates as a social blockchain. So, when users mention products in their posts, these reviews are instantly visible across all the shops that showcase the same product.

 The Paradigm Shift
 For the first time, small independent shops can collaborate seamlessly. In the Web 3.0 landscape, shops tap into the entire Hive community, gaining access to the complete product knowledge base, as well as all product reviews and related content.
 Users from one shop can engage with those from other shops, all within the same digital space! ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1692042785_049eb14f-d912-4a35-be7b-0fc0723a1e50)
 Imagine launching a new shop that's more than just a static brochure—it thrives with a vibrant community passionate about the subject. Now, your website's first visitors can immediately immerse themselves in this community, make new connections, and engage in active discussions. Additionally, your users gain access to sponsored rewards from various merchants and can claim them by sharing product photos. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1692042816_35b6f2cb-fe00-4493-b96e-1155d7b7d7db)
 In a way, social shopping mirrors open-source software development, where sharing code significantly accelerates the growth of the entire ecosystem.
 Similarly, when a website is launched using an open, social, continuously expanding database with product and social data- its success in attracting new users, broadening product collections, offering new sponsored rewards, and spurring more social interactions immediately benefits other projects.
 Indeed, one of the primary success strategies in this open environment is to encourage more people to launch shops similar or even identical to yours. Their success directly translates into your success. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1692042866_e88ca9d5-044c-4bd5-876e-b4ec147127b3)
 In traditional e-commerce, small retailers often find themselves overshadowed by major e-commerce giants such as Amazon. However, with the advent of Web 3.0, these smaller players now have the opportunity to leverage open social networks, pooling their resources to achieve economies of scale that were previously unattainable for standalone shops. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1692043040_95250dec-9cf9-4f8a-ae5d-9c97ba139d1c)
 This unique advantage of social shopping on Hive highlights the power of collaboration in the Web 3 era. The shared knowledge becomes a catalyst for collective success, creating a more integrated, efficient, and user-centric e-commerce experience.
 Social shopping on Hive opens up a world of possibilities, showcasing the revolutionary potential of Web 3.0 ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1692043101_5489efc5-9346-4b3c-afe0-67c3f817a978)


# Lesson 12: Launching a Social Shopping Website
For more details give a link to https://www.waivio.com/object/mev-launching-your-social-shopping-website/page
Are you ready to take your online presence to the next level?
Now you can transform your user profile on Waivio into a dedicated website. This transition allows you to feature your affiliate shop as the main store on your website, while your personal blog will take center stage as the key newsfeed.

Why launch a social shopping website?
Launching a website unlocks new income streams. You will gain access to four sources of revenue:
- Affiliate commissions from referrals (3%-10%);
- Beneficiary commissions (5% of author rewards);
- Referral commissions (7.8%+ of sponsored rewards);
- Advertising revenue from Google AdSense integration ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1699904772_5f241eed-341b-47e4-83bb-fe084fe9cea1)
Moreover, launching a website gives you the freedom to organize and customize your social shop in any way you envision.
You can customize your website to match your branding, including the logo, main banner, and website colours. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1699904921_7a060d45-fce4-42fd-abb4-e717c051a464)
As the website owner, you have full control over the objects displayed on your website. On Waivio there are consensus rules that determine which version of objects to show (decided by the balance of votes), so if your vote is not strong enough certain objects may not appear as you want them to be in your profile shop. In contrast, on the website you have the ultimate control where your vote cannot be challenged. You can also grant administrative privileges to other users that you trust. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1699904955_c71d2913-c995-4c3c-a90f-ddb0322e9177)
Another handy feature is the ability to search for all the items you've marked with a heart on your website.
Plus, if you use the Waivio Chrome Extension to upload products from Amazon to Waivio, these items will automatically appear on your profile and, consequently, on your website.
Your website visitors will be able to log in, post, comment, and upvote posts, follow other users, manage their wallets, and utilize many other tools available on the Hive social blockchain.
Let’s launch your social shopping website!

Step 1: Choosing a name for your website (or linking an existing domain)
Let's begin by navigating to the "TOOLS" section, then under "Websites," click on "Create." Choose "Social.Gifts" from the template options. Think of a sub-domain name that encapsulates the essence of your shop. For example, my shop is focused on baby products for new parents, so I'll put the baby.social.gifts. If the domain is available, proceed to read and accept the terms and conditions and click on "Create new website". ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1699907530_a3ac8dc4-e24b-4207-a9dd-2941a256cc58)
Custom Domain: If you have your own domain that you want to use for your social shopping website, choose “Custom Domain” instead. Select Social.Gifts as the website template. Enter your existing domain. Important: Your domain should be configured according to the instructions provided prior to launching it. For further instructions on setting up and connecting your personal domain please review the attached article.
And that's it - let's check out the website. As you can see, we already have a fully functional website!
By default, your website is created using your own profile, including the profile logo, shop, and blog. However, you can customize it even further to match your brand.
After refreshing the page, you'll find settings and configurations for your new website.

Step 2. Configuration
In the Configuration section, you'll have the opportunity to customize your shop's appearance. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1699905959_24bb1346-ee56-4834-b86b-6df961551190)
2.1 Color
Choose the colours for your text and buttons that align with your brand's aesthetics.
2.2 - 2.3 Desktop and Mobile Logo
Next, if you want to change your logo, upload both your desktop and mobile logos to ensure a consistent look across all devices.
2.4 List Default Images
If a website has products organized in categories but doesn’t have specific images for them your user logo will be used as a default image. You can change upload a new image in "list default images" section.
2.3 Main Banner
Let's add a banner to be displayed at the top of all website pages. Here I am using an image I generated with Midjourney (Use the --ar 16:4 command to create narrow banners in MJ.)
2.4 Base Object
In the "Base Object" section, you can choose to link your website to a specific user profile or even a public object on the Hive blockchain.
By default, it's linked to your own profile, and as a result, the information from your profile is transformed into a dedicated website, including your shop and your blog. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1699906064_e9b1722b-df70-42a3-89f6-a5f4f8993a66)
If you are looking to launch a themed website, you can easily create an advanced shop with just a click of a button by leveraging existing projects with thousands of products carefully organized in categories. And once you add affiliate codes, all of these thousands of products will include your codes in the purchase links.
For example, let’s use an existing business object called the Camping Checklist https://www.waivio.com/object/7ujfq-shop“
” (lbm-camping-checklist) which has hundreds of categories and thousands of camping-related products listed. By simply setting it as the base object for my site, my entire website will instantly become one of the most comprehensive camping sites out there. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1699906039_bbe08d3c-0f17-4382-931c-e945e798eaaf)
Another example is the “
Coffee Time
” object (3urenj-coffee-shop), which also includes thousands of coffee-making products, serving accessories, various types of coffee and even books. As you can see, these advanced websites not only feature product catalogs but also include information pages (like the Checklist) and community newsfeeds.
One more example is the “
Clean Girl Aesthetics
” object (tlc-clean-girl-aesthetics), which features thousands of make-up and beauty products that align with clean girl aesthetics.
As the list of objects continues to expand with more people creating websites, please see the descriptions to explore other existing projects: https://www.waivio.com/object/ewg-social-gifts-projects/webpage
If your desired topic for your affiliate website isn't covered here, you can create your own business object, this will be explained in the Advanced Shop Tutorial.
2.5 Default Hashtags
A default hashtag will be automatically added to all new posts created by users on your website. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1699906202_b46aae44-1466-4231-abe8-468fff260497)
This feature is particularly beneficial for websites employing custom newsfeeds that display posts with specific hashtags only. A default hashtag helps guarantee that users won't overlook adding the tag, ensuring their post appears on the website. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1699906248_7124918f-c0e6-46ef-a2c4-f086aa9dd749)
If your website doesn't utilize custom newsfeeds, you can leave this field empty.
2.6 Website Header
You can also customize the website header, such as changing Baby.Social.Gifts to your brand name or a short message.

Step 3. Settings
Let's move on to the "Settings" section to fine-tune the functionality of the website.
3.1 – 3.2 Language and Currency
Here, you can select the language and currency for your website. If you want to
market your website in a specific location, you can choose your local language and currency; otherwise, English and USD are solid choices.
3.3 Google Analytics 4 Property ID
Next, you can add your Google Analytics 4 property ID to get detailed reports and insights into the performance of your website, such as website activity, visitor count, geographical distribution of your audience and other metrics. You can get this ID by creating a Google Analytics account for your website. Then just copy and paste the ID, and you will see your website statistics in your Google Analytics account. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1699906382_b65de955-cc44-45c3-8425-62c4417c70ef)
If you want to track conversions on your website, you can use the "buy_now" event. To configute it go to Admin -> Data Display -> Events -> turn on the “buy_now” event. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1699907495_147c0805-2cae-4c50-a204-831db1eeb0bf)
Buy_now is triggered every time a visitor clicks a button that takes them to an affiliated site, such as Amazon, Walmart, Target, or any other.
3.4 Beneficiary Payment
When your visitor receives upvotes for the posts they publish on your website – you can get a commission on their author rewards. In the following section – indicate which account would receive such commission and how much commission you want to collect (this value is set to 5% by default). ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1699906682_baa713d2-6de7-4d19-b5fa-0ac80459bccb)
3.5 Referral Payment
You can also earn a commission when your visitors participate in sponsored campaigns, such as when they write a review for a sponsored product. Again, choose the recipient account.
If a product in your shop gets a sponsored reward - it will automatically be reflected on your website - you don’t need to do anything on your part. Your visitors will be able to see all the sponsored products and submit their reviews on your website to get the reward. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1699906728_795b8a49-8975-446e-9a48-1baeef583943)
Sponsors define the commission levels provided to all parties assisting them in facilitating transactions. The referral portion of the sponsored rewards is set at a minimum level of 2.8%, but it can be higher for specific campaigns. In combination with the 5% author rewards, your total commissions from sponsored rewards will be 7.8%. Please refer to the referral policy for more information.
3.6 CLICK "SAVE" to save your settings, and your selections will be applied to your website.

Step 4. Affiliate Codes
Now let's move to affiliate codes. Just like you did for your profile shop, search relevant affiliate programs and input your affiliate codes. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1699907465_c3fcc4c0-37d1-489b-9476-db98df21d554)
This integration ensures that all your products in your shop come with your affiliate codes, giving you the opportunity to earn with visitors every purchase.
It's useful to occasionally check that your affiliate codes are active, especially for Amazon, since the codes can expire if a certain threshold in sales is not achieved. That's the beauty of this interface because, unlike other platforms, if your code expires, here, you won't need to update it individually for every product. Just update it one time here and it will automatically be applied to all your products.

Step 5: Website Hosting
To keep your website up and running, there are hosting fees associated with maintaining your online presence on Social.Gifts. When you're ready to fund your website, navigate to the "Manage" tab, where you'll find the button "Pay Now." Here choose the amount you can transfer in WAIV tokens to pay the hosting fees. WAIV tokens will be converted to USD at the current market rate. Click Continue to sign and finish the transaction. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1699907415_7755a35e-993d-4c29-a2e5-0e778f5bbdad)
For hosting prices check the info in the section. Currently, for active websites, the plan starts at 1 USD/day, which includes up to 200 daily visitors. There is an additional fee of 0.005 USD per day for every extra active user. If you want to retain your website name without running the website, a fee of 0.20 USD/day is applied. You can change the status of your website by checking or unchecking the checkmark under the "active" column.

What's next? 😉
Now that your configuration and setup are complete, it's time to reveal your Social.Gifts shop to the world.
Congratulations on launching your very own Social.Gifts website!

Step 1: Discovering Your Shop's Theme
The foundation of a successful shop lies in its theme. It's time to brainstorm and identify what resonates with you and your potential customers. Whether it's camping products, baby products, fitness gear, makeup, or any other niche, pick a theme that aligns with your interests and expertise.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700516628_69860ab8-1af6-42c3-a8b7-573312af69f8)

Step 2: Creating a business object
To organize your shop effectively, we will need to create a business object specifically for your shop. If a similar-themed website already exists, you can search for it and open the existing business object. Then, you can contribute to its development by adding more products or categories to it.
However, if you're starting from scratch, click the "write post" button and under "Create New Object," click on "business". Assign a name to your business – it can match your website, such as "baby.social.gifts". Click on the link to open the newly created business object in a new tab.

Step 3: The Main Menu
A business object has its own menu. When this object is linked as the base object on the website, this object's menu will be shown as the main menu on the website. For our object, the first menu item will be a Shop.
Click "+Menu item", then "Create new object"
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700520368_49682807-4879-473a-84a2-9de9dbadbe1f)
We will create a new object with that name and select "list" as its type because the shop will contain links to other lists, products, or pages.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700520480_4e5dd8e8-8bf3-4fe5-b9f7-5973dba9a70b)
Later in this Shop list, we can create other sub-lists (subcategories), such as Clothing, Food, and Nursery.
The next menu item will be a Bookstore. This is also going to be a separate list with links to books related to our topic.
If you want some help to establish categories for your website, you can use ChatGPT. Use a prompt like "Suggest categories and subcategories for an online [your theme, e.g. fitness] shop.", and ChatGPT will give you some ideas. You can review the categories generated by ChatGPT and select the ones that align with your vision.

Step 4: Adding Lists with Products
4.1 Setting Up Your Lists
Let’s start with creating categories in our Shop. It's empty right now, but let's add our higher-level categories to it, such as clothing, feeding, and nursery. To add a category, click "Create new object".
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700520525_5fc0ffb1-8621-4511-aa3c-56fd5ab36d3a)
Write the name of the category, such as "Nursery", and again choose the "list" as the type, since our category will have subcategories such as beds, mattresses, storage solutions, decor and so on.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700520545_d9717490-925b-42ac-b6ae-ac3c80cca6bd)
If you already have lists created, you can add them by searching for them in the search bar.
4.2 Establishing Subcategories
After adding all the general categories, we can add subcategories to organize the shop's inventory even further.
For instance, let's add subcategories to "Nursery,". Click on the category– you will see that now you are in "My Shop -> Nursery".
Here, we can repeat the process: click "Create new object", write the name of the subcategory such as "Decor", and choose a "list" as the type.
Similarly, you can create sub-subcategories. For example, decor can be further broken down into wall stickers, posters, carpets and so on.
4.3 Adding Products
When a category is specific enough and doesn't need a further breakdown, you can add products to it. For example, you can add products by searching for them in the search bar.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700520616_f93b1ea0-dce3-4d82-846c-88bfecd8243a)
If you can not find the products you want to add to your website here, you can easily add them using the Waivio’s Chrome extension. Check out the tutorial on the extension for more details.
If you want to add multiple items, you can check out the series of tutorials on importing products on the Hive blockchain to learn a quick way for bulk importing.
You may also find using chatGPT helpful to find the best products for the shop. For instance, a prompt like this: "Provide a list of top 20 products according to user reviews for [your product category, e.g. baby mats]". And ChatGPT will generate a list of products you can choose from.
To add products, search for them by name or ASIN number. It is receommended to record ASIN numbers of products during the data import, as product names can vary while product numbers remain constant. Then, click on the product and click “Submit.”
4.4 Launching a website with our business object
To launch a website using this business object - navigate to "Tools," then under "Websites," click on your website's name. In configuration, replace the base object with the business object we've just created.
4.5 List Avatars
Now our products are nicely organized in categories. However, the categories appear rather dull with default images as icons. Let's change that and add some images!
Head over to the business object and click on the category, such as "Nursery." Click on the hyperlink at the top to open the category list in a new tab. Here, you can easily add an avatar image to your category (list).
Click "Edit," navigate to "Settings," and click on "Avatar." Upload your image or provide a link. For instance, here, I used an AI-generated image from Midjourney. Click "Submit," and that's it!
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700520736_9cf55c56-0a61-4450-bfbb-e14e39cecdf9)
Let's add images to other categories. All the images I am uploading were generated by Midjourney – if you are curious to learn how check one of our tutorials about using AI tools for creating great-looking shops.
Now that you know how to add lists of products - you can experiment with how you arrange them on your website. For example, https://coffeetime.social.gifts has three lists with products "Equipment", "Accessories", and "Coffee". Whereas https://GoCampingList.com – has all the products under "Shop". It also has a menu item called "Books". Bookstore is a list of "book" type objects.
In addition, camping.social.gifts has other menu items, such as a Checklist, which is a simple page with information. Camplife is a newsfeed with posts about camping. Legal is a list of pages added to all websites hosted by Waivio. Legal page is added automatically to all websites but you can also add your own legal documents in a similar way. Let's add these elements to our website.

Step 5: Adding a Bookstore
Let’s start by adding a menu item called "Books" that will contain top books for children and parents. Click "Create new object" and enter "Books" as the name. For the type, select "list". Once the list has been created, you can add categories to it, such as "Parenting books", "Baby board books", and "Storybooks".
Then, let’s add some books. This is a very similar process to adding products - just search for the ASIN number of the book and click “Submit”.

Step 6: Adding pages
Let’s also add a page to our website with a checklist of all the baby products every new parent should have.
Add a new menu item, click “Create new object” -> enter a name as it would appear on your website menu, e.g. “New Parent Checklist.” For the type – choose “page”, and click “Confirm”. Then, you can add content such as an article or a checklist – then just click “Ready to Publish” and “Submit”.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700520764_ee85d679-8418-4ac7-982d-4b8efe428bb2)

Step 7: Adding a custom newsfeed
Let's move on to custom newsfeeds. Hive is an active social blockchain where many users create posts on various topics. We can filter relevant posts using hashtags that match the topic of the website.
The easiest way to add a custom newsfeed is to click on “Write post” button and choose "newsfeed" from the selection.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700520798_f3603977-91f4-435d-8183-da02652bda72)
Enter a name, such as “Community”, We will link this newsfeed to our business object later after we are done configuring it.
To configure the newsfeed, open this newsfeed object in a new tab.
Click on "Edit", then click on "Newsfilter."
Here, you can add filter rules to display only a specific type of posts:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700520825_54f68fa3-d008-42f2-85e2-79574d994b24)
For example, for my website, I can add a "baby" hashtag in Filter Rule 1. And click "Add new rule" to add a "parenting" hashtag in Filter Rule 2. This will show posts that have these hashtags.
You can also filter out certain posts. For example, I don't want to see posts that are related to "animals" that might have a "baby" hashtag in them. So I will put "animals" in the Ignore Rule.
Another way to personalize your news feed is by choosing the type of object (e.g., a book, a product, a place, etc.) And only the posts related to that category will be displayed on your newsfeed. For example, to show all the posts on baby and parenting products, I can add "product" in this field.
To show baby and parenting posts only from specific users, I can add these users in the “users field”.
If you want to show all the posts of a specific user, like your dedicated channel, then remove all the other filters and just add that user.
Now to link the newsfeed to our business object – let’s open our business object. Click on Menu item. Enter a name for the newsfeed as it would appear on your website's menu. In the search bar, look for your newsfeed by a name or a permlink. There might be a lot of objects with the same name, so I recommend searching by the premlink, as it is a unique identifier of the object. It’s located on the object’s link after object/ e.g. this is the object's link https://www.waivio.com/object/5xjmmi-community and the premlink is 5xjmmi-community
Click "Submit" once the object is found.

Step 8: Adding widgets
If you want to integrate Google Forms, Calendly, or other external tools with your website, you can do so by adding widgets.
Click on “Write post” button and choose a "widget" from the selection – enter a name, such as “Contact Form”.
Your widget will now be created. We will link it to our business object later.
 To configure the widget, open it in a new tab.
In the widget object window, click "Edit"; under "Widget", click to add a "Form".
For example, let's add a Google Form. Have the link ready.
First, add a title (such as,"Contact Form"). Under columns, you can choose how much space you want the form to fill. For example, if you choose a middle column, the form will fill only the middle column, but if you choose "entire width" the form will fill all three columns. For Google Forms, I recommend selecting Middle + Right. Then, select the form type – a link or a widget. For Google Forms, select a link. Then, copy the Google Forms link and paste it into the space provided. Then click Submit.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700521015_fcf8e859-7ced-4796-a48e-183628314b7a)
If you want to paste the widget embed code instead of the link, then select "widget" as the form type and enter the widget embed code in the space provided. Here is the website where you customize your widgets: https://elfsight.com/widgets/
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700521032_62d0f984-8c57-48ff-9bdf-9e2c32f5a5f3)
Let’s link the widget to our business object –open the business object. Click on "Menu item" and enter a name for the widget as it would appear on your website's menu, in the search bar – look for the widget by a name or a premlink. Click "Submit" once the object is found.

Step 9. Sorting
Finally, you can change the order of menu items as they would appear on your website. Click on "Menu sorting", drag and drop to rearrange the menu items in the desired order. Click "Submit".
You can also sort the items inside the categories lists. Lists have their own sorting option. Open the list in a new tab – “Edit” – under “List” click on “List Sorting” – and rearrange the items in the desired order.
By integrating categories, feeds, informative pages, and more, we've transformed the website into a fully functional and captivating platform. While I made some suggestions for the website structure, you can arrange your website any way you envision.

What's next?
Congratulations! You've taken your shop from an idea to a well-structured platform that aligns with your theme!
You've laid the groundwork for an exceptional shop that's tailored to your expertise and passion. With great product organization, newsfeed, and information pages, your shop is ready to showcase an array of products that cater to your audience's needs and interests.

Now it's time to think about how to market your website to bring it to a larger audience and boost your revenue. In the upcoming tutorials, we will discuss SEO tools, marketing and analytics strategies that you can implement for your website.


# Custom domain - Connecting GoDaddy Domain to Waivio to Create a Site. (Applicable only for custom domain site)
For more details give a link to https://www.waivio.com/object/qym-custom-domain/page.
Discover how to integrate a domain from platforms like GoDaddy with Waivio, enabling you to craft a website using Waivio templates. This guide delves into Cloudflare setup, DNS record configuration, and nameserver integration. Suitable for domains from multiple platforms.
This guide explains how to connect a domain, initially created on platforms like GoDaddy, to Waivio. This allows you to construct a website using a Waivio template while still maintaining a custom domain.
The instructions are divided into three key sections: setting up the domain in Cloudflare, configuring the DNS record, and integrating Cloudflare's nameservers on GoDaddy.
Although GoDaddy is highlighted as an example for domain acquisition, the methods can apply to any similar platform.
Additional settings for custom domain:

1. Set up Your Domain with Cloudflare:
Go to Cloudflare.
If you don't have an account, sign up; otherwise, log in.
On the main page, click "Get started."
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67378322/268044728-0cdbca0c-ef86-4676-a8bb-39033543259b.png)
Enter your domain in the provided field and click "Continue."
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67378322/268044757-27c97718-ef7d-401e-b40f-300352728d11.png)
Select the free plan and proceed by clicking "Continue."

Update the IPv4 address field to 206.189.200.117
    The "Name" field typically auto-populates with your primary domain, which is correct.
   If you face any issues or need to create this record from scratch, and the 'Name' field is empty, just enter '@'. This symbol, used by itself without any extra text, signifies the root of your main address. To summarize, your settings should be:
    Type: A
    Name: @
    IPv4 address: 206.189.200.117
Save the changes.

# Search Engine Web Content Discovery: A Guide to Enabling Crawler Hints with Cloudflare's IndexNow Integration (Applicable only for custom domain site)
For more details give a link to https://www.waivio.com/object/yfw-web-content-discovery-a-guide-to-enabling-crawler-hints-with-cloudflare-s-indexnow-integration/page.
Crawler Hints, integrated with the IndexNow protocol, is a revolutionary approach by Cloudflare to enhance how search engines interact with website content. Developed by Microsoft and Yandex, IndexNow serves as an efficient mechanism for website owners to instantly inform search engines about content updates. This protocol acts as a direct signal to search engines, notifying them of new, updated, or deleted content, thereby allowing for a more immediate reflection of these changes in search results. This system addresses the traditional delay in content discovery by search engines, which could range from days to weeks.
Setting Up Crawler Hints
1. Log into your Cloudflare dashboard.
2. Select your domain.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1701854740_9228a2b3-8ba2-40ee-8f17-32552c0e7a2e)
3. Navigate to 'Caching' in the left sidebar.
4. Go to 'Configuration'.
5. Scroll to the 'Crawler Hints' section.
6. Enable the toggle.

# HiveFest 2023: Launching Clean Girl Social Shop on Hive
Here is a copy of the presentation I delivered at HiveFest 2023, Rosarito, Mexico:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695874487_297ba7f1-d046-4298-b798-a150db554ebd
Day 2 of HiveFest, my presentation starts at 1 hour 31 minutes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAGAqMn4CgU
Today, I'll discuss my personal experience launching the CleanGirl.Social.Gifts website to demonstrate its simplicity. You can choose any theme you're passionate or knowledgeable about and create your social shop.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695838896_6dbdb8ce-f954-4987-ae1d-a426944d4261
 Now, speaking about the Clean Girl Aesthetics, it embodies a contemporary approach to simplicity and elegance, making it versatile and the reason I chose this theme. The website's purpose is to inspire users to replicate this aesthetic in their lives.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695838949_22c2d039-4db6-48c7-82ac-80882b1bf833
 During our shop's launch, we initially planned to have a few categories with several hundred items. However, as we progressed, we realized the theme's expansive nature. We now have over 200 categories nearing 3,000 items, with some categories still awaiting products. Rest assured, we're diligently expanding our collection.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695842181_2ede8bfc-2d9c-428a-bce6-d5809d34b90e
 Upon visiting a product page, the layout is user-friendly. It closely mirrors familiar e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Walmart. Features include product titles, galleries, ratings, various options (like size and color), detailed descriptions, and suggestions for similar items. Furthermore, our user reviews are direct posts on Hive.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695842223_441d0192-e845-4495-94c2-2f14e14b3f40
 Leveraging Hive's community spirit, users can use the hashtag #cleangirl, allowing their personal posts to appear on our inspiration page. This feature grants visibility to shoppers and provides another outlet for content sharing.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695842292_105bdeaa-bb0c-44ab-8bf5-148eb5e9e593
 Now, let's delve into the behind-the-scenes of our website's creation. With Waivio technology, our backend operations were streamlined. I created a public object on Hive named "Clean Girl Aesthetics" and established categories and subcategories. After linking this public object to my website, the content on Waivio mirrored onto the site. This setup also enables trusted team members to collaborate efficiently.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695842335_83ccfcdb-154d-45bd-967a-6e65d726bd12
 Moreover, social shop is already optimized for mobile users. Modern mobile apps with strong user engagement prioritize vibrant images and videos.

 Make sure to add your affiliate codes. For Amazon, you can even enter codes for different geographies, such as Amazon.com, Amazon.ca, and so on. Affiliate codes will be automatically added to all the products based on the geo-location of the website visitor.

 When managing over 200 categories and thousands of items, a bit of structure is crucial. You might need assistance to ensure smooth navigation. We utilize ChatGPT. You can ask for suggestions such as categories and subcategories for a 'clean girl aesthetic' online shop. You can delve deeper, requesting details on specific items, like high-quality brand cleansers that fit the 'clean girl aesthetic' based on reviews.
But remember, ChatGPT is just a tool; always apply your own judgment and vision for your site.

 Once you've identified products for your site, start by checking Waivio to see if the item already exists. If not, use Amazon and the Waivio Chrome extension. Make sure you're using the latest version for optimal performance. This extension also supports other major online stores, such as Walmart and Sephora.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695842486_955e41d2-d7b8-40cb-8142-7884330bef8d
 This is how the product page appears on the site after the item has been uploaded to Hive. Once the product is published on Hive, users can reference it in their posts. All such posts will then appear as reviews on the product page.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695842539_1a0d53e1-0323-4eb9-bf4e-efee866c00de
 After setting up categories and adding items, focus on the site's visual aesthetics. Although we initially tried using stock photos for all the categories and subcategories in the social shop, finding the right images that matched our theme proved to be challenging. Therefore, we turned to AI solutions like MidJourney.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695842831_b60a74a6-852e-44e2-84f7-b20b51527b7a
 When using MidJourney, ensure you have a clear theme and provide a list of specific keywords. For instance, for this project, I specify 'white marble background' to ensure consistency. If you come across an inspiring image elsewhere, include a link in your request. MidJourney takes the suggested image into account while creating unique images.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695843070_c15685a6-c62a-49d8-99b6-6a3f2f75d110
This is the blueprint for crafting a social shop, complete with captivating visuals, an extensive product range, and a vibrant community.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695844124_3796f17b-b413-4af2-bddf-329eba72dc06
 For all the work I've done – the images, the categories, the added items – I'm about to hand it all over to you. In just a few minutes, I'll show you how to replicate the site and take full ownership.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695844394_ae03faa7-64a4-4972-8e43-e54501c7f0f0
 Start by choosing your site's name. For demonstration, I've named it cleanlook.social.gifts. Design your unique logo and the main banner.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695870072_336315ec-bed7-49f7-8eeb-2ff47b7416ba
 Open Waivio, navigate to Tools > Create Website. Under Website Template, select social.gifts.
Enter your site's name, like 'cleanlook'.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695844889_fec15bc7-d051-42b1-a885-09459d667ffe
 Have fun with customization: pick website colors and upload your logo.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695844957_a9a3937c-b1d7-4dca-b134-2d94c24aa758
 Now, the pivotal step: search for 'Clean Girl Aesthetic' and select it as the Base Object for your website. The entire site's navigation and architecture will stem from this object.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695844998_fd9d2b46-1dde-42c9-ade8-bad464b2f143
 Do not forget to add your affiliate codes.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695845091_01e33d91-f298-42d8-9515-3ec349e1fbf0
 Voilà! The website is now yours, complete with your branding and colors, plus your affiliate codes attached to the thousands of products on the site.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695870025_99a0bcdd-256e-476e-94e6-e5fd843875c7
 This highlights the groundbreaking nature of decentralization and web3. In traditional e-commerce, every shop operates with its own user database, product knowledge base, and starts gathering user reviews from ground zero.
However, with Hive, all shops share a common user base, product knowledge base, reviews and sponsored rewards. If your adaptation of my project thrives, it inherently means mine does too. Your success translates to more users, enriched content, more products, reviews and rewards. Concurrently, my users gain access to all that data, connecting with more peers, engaging in interesting discussions and claiming more rewards.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695845213_6e5b576f-2d5d-4a9d-9ec5-964dc0f66706
Naturally, each site will earn affiliate commissions from its own traffic and referrals. However, the growth in users and content is a shared benefit across all projects. This collaborative approach enables shops to reach a scale that's nearly unattainable for standalone entities.
Social shopping on Hive is genuinely revolutionary. It's also an innovative and effective method to introduce more users to Hive and foster a sense of community.

# Custom Domains for Social.Gifts Websites
Waivio is introducing custom domain names for social shopping websites.
Previously, users were restricted to launching websites under the *.social.gifts domain. This update allows for the use of custom domain names, providing more flexibility and branding opportunities for website owners.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1701392083_06a110d1-8478-4b2e-b00a-1dfbd800a5e0
Domain Protection via Cloudflare
All custom domains must have a robust DDoS protection. This service is provided by Cloudflare.com at no additional cost and is known for its effectiveness in safeguarding websites against DDoS and other attacks.
Domain Configuration Requirements
Before launching a new website with a custom domain, certain configuration steps must be completed:
- General Instructions (https://www.waivio.com/object/qym-custom-domain/page): Domain configuration via GoDaddy, Cloudflare.
- Secure Connections (https://www.waivio.com/object/qym-custom-domain/page#pvs-ensuring-secure-connections-manual-https-configuration-for-custom-domain-on-cloudflare): Enforcing the use of HTTPS protocol.
- Smooth Redirects (https://www.waivio.com/object/qym-custom-domain/page#ckq-ensuring-smooth-redirects-manual-www-to-apex-domain-setup-on-cloudflare): Forwarding from 'www' to the apex (primary) domain.
New Domain Registration
For those who do not yet own a domain name, purchasing directly through Cloudflare.com might be a cost-effective option.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1701452512_c85f2d19-5cbc-4b9c-99cc-d541ecd1c7bf
Additionally, domains purchased through Cloudflare are automatically hosted on their nameservers, which ensures DDoS protection and simplifies the setup process.
Other Updates:
1. Objects / Image viewer - allow approve/reject votes, album & avatar selection directly in the viewer (2188);
2. Campaigns / Sponsors - simplify the process of rejecting posts and adding users to the black list (5179, 5180);

# Improving SEO with Canonical Links for Hosted Websites
Waivio takes a significant step forward in addressing a common challenge faced by all our hosted social shopping sites—duplicate content originating from the Hive blockchain. Each site hosted by Waivio mirrors the same comprehensive array of information from the Hive blockchain, including user profiles, posts, objects, products, and more. This widespread duplication poses a unique problem: search engines like Google struggle to identify the original source of this content, often leading to confusion and inefficiency in search rankings.
Introducing Canonical URLs:
To combat this issue, Waivio is excited to launch a system of canonical URLs. This system serves as a direct communication line to search engines, clarifying which page is the authoritative source of the information.
How It Works:
If a new post is submitted via a hosted website, such as https://CoffeeShop.Gifts, all other websites, including https://waivio.com, will use canonical URLs to reference back to the post on the originating website.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1702598810_f26c1c08-f191-4f9e-8fc3-868752820499
This method significantly improves the ability of search engines to identify and prioritize original content, enhancing the SEO of the originating website.
Benefits for Website Operators and Hive Users:
Improved Search Engine Rankings: By posting more original content through their websites, operators can gain better positioning in search engine results.
Incentives for Onboarding New Users: The canonical address for user profiles is determined by the origin of their first post, making it advantageous to onboard new Hive users through your website.
Complex Attribution for Objects: The canonical attribution for objects is a bit more intricate. The 'Description' field is pivotal in this process. If a user who posted a winning description hosts their website, canonical links will point to that object on their website from all other sites where the product is displayed with that description.
Each product can have multiple descriptions, with separate attributions calculated for each version.
Selecting the Website:
Users with multiple hosted websites can designate which site should receive all the canonical credits for objects.
To configure, navigate to Tools, Websites - Manage, and select the website for canonical attribution. Remember, only one website can be the primary recipient of canonical referrals.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1702598969_b6fdd006-44e6-4d78-bdfe-8957d7c940b8
By posting original content on your hosted website, and encouraging your users to do the same, you can significantly enhance your site's search engine rankings. This improvement is driven by other websites pointing back to your website as the canonical source. Additionally, onboarding new Hive users and adding more products and objects further increases the number of inbound references, improves visibility in search engines, and brings more visitors.

# Boosting Social Shopping: 10X Reduction in Upvote Requirements on Waivio
Exciting news for all social shop owners and shopping enthusiasts! Waivio has rolled out an update that significantly lowers the barrier for publishing product updates on the Hive blockchain. With a remarkable 10X reduction in upvote requirements, it's now easier than ever for users to share and manage extensive product catalogs.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1715288913_bc6bdd6f-4919-4eff-8ff8-3ae31a3f30ae
What's New?
Previously, the threshold to upvote object updates on Waivio required a minimum of $0.001 WAIV Power per update. Now, this requirement has been slashed to just $0.0001 per update (Tasks: 6644, 6645). This strategic change is specifically designed to empower social shop owners and merchants by allowing them to publish ten times as many updates about products, businesses, pages, lists, and other objects with the same amount of WAIV Power as before.
Why the Change?
This update was prompted by the increasing demand from social shop owners who are keen to expand their online collections with a broader range of products. Additionally, merchants looking to publish their product catalogs on the Hive blockchain can now do so more frequently and comprehensively. This enables their affiliate partners to more effectively create and manage social shops, leveraging a larger variety of products, engaging larger audiences, and accumulating reviews through Waivio’s open architecture.
Data Import Tools
Waivio continues to streamline the process of blockchain-based catalog management with its efficient Data Import Tools (https://www.waivio.com/object/ylr-waivio/page#6vcmab-tutorials/uxp-social-gifts/uiy-how-to-import-products-on-hive). Merchants can now easily export their product catalogs to a JSON file that complies with Waivio's data schema. This file can be effortlessly uploaded using Waivio’s Data Import tool. For existing products on the blockchain, only changes will be identified and published, ensuring that product details remain accurate across all social shopping websites.
Waivio Chrome Extension
For added convenience, Waivio offers a special Chrome Extension (https://www.waivio.com/object/ylr-waivio/page#6vcmab-tutorials/uxp-social-gifts/kda-waivio-chrome-extension-tutorial) for social shop owners. This tool simplifies the process of uploading product information from major e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Walmart. Users simply navigate to a product page, activate the extension, and the product details are automatically uploaded to the Hive blockchain and integrated into the user’s social shop. This feature is very useful for adding new products as well as for keeping product listings up to date with minimal effort.
The Impact
This reduction in upvote requirements is a strategic move by Waivio to accommodate the growing needs of social shop owners. By facilitating more frequent updates, Waivio enables a vibrant, continually evolving online shopping experience.
Explore the possibilities by checking out some of the vibrant social shops (https://www.waivio.com/object/ewg-social-gifts-projects/webpage) and learn how you can launch your own social shop in just 10 minutes (https://www.waivio.com/@cryptodive/launch-a-full-shop-in-10-min)!

# Social Shopping Unveiled: A Deep Dive into Conversion Rates
Today, I'd like to share the results of my recent experiment aimed at analyzing the efficiency of social shopping sites in generating affiliate sales via Amazon, centered around a popular product: the French Press Coffee Maker.
The strategy was straightforward: direct traffic towards a select list of 20 French Press Coffee Makers (https://coffeeshop.gifts/checklist/2x9p9j-shop?currObj=eoi-french-press-coffee-makers#ype-coffee-makers/eoi-french-press-coffee-makers) with Amazon links and detailed descriptions, then track and analyze the conversion rates.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1712088568_a473a2bd-0a2d-45b8-828a-cbf08609920b
This exploration was divided into two distinct phases to gain insights into consumer behavior under different shopping conditions. The first phase coincided with the bustling holiday season, and the second unfolded during a regular shopping interval.
Holiday Shopping Phase
(November 20 - December 20, 2023)
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1712088609_1fef793c-6f0d-4ce5-9c52-9181cc3ddbee
Traffic and Engagement: Out of 1,100 visitors, 189 clicked through to Amazon, showcasing a 17% click-through rate (CTR).
Conversion to Purchase: These clicks translated into 32 purchases, equating to an impressive 17% conversion rate from clicks to sales.
Overall Conversion: The overall visitor-to-purchase conversion rate stood at 3%, a notable achievement.
Regular Shopping Phase
(February 1-29, 2024)
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1712088681_a35455cc-4496-4d24-9350-965304bfacc7
Traffic and Engagement: From 506 visitors, 72 clicked through, achieving a 14% CTR.
Conversion to Purchase: This engagement resulted in 10 purchases, maintaining a 14% conversion rate from clicks to sales.
Overall Conversion: Here, the conversion rate slightly decreased to 2%.
Financial Performance and Benchmarking
The overall visitor-to-sales conversion rates were impressive: 3% and 2% for the respective phases.
Earnings: The experiments generated commissions of $35.20 and $15.04, respectively, from products priced around $30, within Amazon's 3%-4% commission range for this category.
Crucial to this analysis was the evaluation of performance through RPM (Revenues Per Mille https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/190515?hl=en) and EPVM (Earnings Per Visitor Mille https://vibetrace.com/revenue-per-visitor/), which demonstrated decent efficiency:
During the holiday season, the rates were $14.67 RPM and $32 EPVM.
During the regular shopping period, the figures were $8.85 RPM and $29.72 EPVM.
These results exceed industry benchmarks and highlight the effectiveness of social shopping sites in monetizing targeted audiences.
Expanding Beyond the Experiment
This experiment focused on a single item. However, the true value of social shopping is revealed in curating collections of products that can be purchased together, thus significantly improving revenue per visitor.
For example, a camping site can offer a collection of 200 essentials for outdoor family trips. An interior design site might curate a collection to inspire a seasonal refresh, featuring matching pillows, candles, and covers. Beauty sites can propose comprehensive skincare routines requiring a suite of products, while fashion shops can assemble outfits for a specific style.
Moreover, revenue opportunities extend beyond direct affiliate sales. Website owners can benefit from commissions on user-generated posts, sponsored rewards claimed by users, AdSense advertising, and even by managing rewards programs for brands.
In essence, if you're an influencer or aspiring to become one, leveraging a social shopping site can serve as an exceptionally effective platform for showcasing curated shopping collections to your friends and followers, blending community engagement with commercial opportunity seamlessly.

# Dining.Gifts by Waivio - Open Business 3.0 Process In Action
Waivio is proud to introduce the first fully operational open Business 3.0 process - https://dining.gifts
Dining.Gifts is a decentralized global platfrom for restaurant rebates.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1618179877_5fe236b2-ad31-40b1-94ce-a050a855eecd
Dining.Gifts is a type 3.0 business and it is using an open business process. This approach allows independent parties to operate as a single, well-managed business and collectively achieve the scale they could not achieve on their own.
Open architecture allows the free flow of information between participating businesses. All the information about restaurants, menus and rewards is published on the Hive public blockchain, and can be freely accessed by all users, guides and apps.
Dining.Gifts website is operated by Waivio Technologies Inc., but all of the data, including user profiles, social graphs and transactions is coming directly from the Hive social blockchain. In fact, you can launch your own highly interactive social website within minutes using Waivio.com and it will have all the restaurant listings, menus, rewards, user profiles, influencers and news feeds. And you don't need to ask anyone's permission to use all that data or to start your own Dining.Gifts business.
Users are no longer "owned" by websites
Traditional websites are trying to build their own user databases. And this creates a lot of inconvenience for the users, because they have to remember many passwords, create and maintain multiple social profiles, their followers and connections are very fragmented and on top of that their accounts can be censored and closed, causing them to lose all their work!
But there is no central authority on a decentralized social network. Control is now in the hands of users themselves. Users are no longer "owned" by websites and they can use any Hive-compatible website, as their followers will be informed of their posts and comments, regardless of the Hive app they are currently using.
The open social blockchain allows users to maintain full control over their privacy, posts and votes, social connections, and funds in their accounts. Users thus become the main beneficiaries of their own work and attention.
Open access
All participants in an open business process have equal access to all data and user information.
When one of the websites brings in more users, everyone benefits, as the additional users make new connections, publish new content, and all of this is synchronized between all the other websites through the Hive social blockchain. When one guide adds one more restaurant, updates menus or launches new rewards campaigns, all the other websites will also be able to present new content and rewards to their visitors.
On one hand, this increases the visibility of the rewards, but on the other it also allows websites to offer a wider selection of rewards to their visitors and receive commissions for facilitating transactions.
The open business process transforms competition into synergy and turns a zero-sum competition into a shared success, allowing independent players to operate as one entity.
Rapid scaling
The open business process is designed for rapid scaling.
First of all, no permission is required to participate in the process. Anyone can join and receive payments for their work.
Second, participants can focus on a specific role in the business process without having to build everything else. A good salesperson can focus on managing rebate programs for restaurants, while a good marketer or influencer can focus on building an audience for their branded website and collecting fees for distributing rewards to users.
Third, it can be scaled internationally, as the same open source technology can be used worldwide, while business operations can quickly adapt to local context, pricing and legal requirements.
Improvements in technology and services become immediately available to all participants. Best practices can be freely shared because the success of each participant contributes directly to the success of everyone involved in the project.
Fair distribution of benefits
The decentralized social chain does not have a central authority or a gatekeeper. It does not need to maximize quarterly profits for shareholders. Instead, any benefits that arise from the increased scale of operations are shared among all parties based on their ongoing contribution to the business process.
Dining.Gifts business roles
There are many key roles in the Dining.Gifts open business process:
users - earn tangible rewards for sharing dish photos;
restaurants - bring new customers and create social impact, while paying for results only;
guides - manage rebate programs for restaurants (ex, 25%+ commissions);
influencers - promote rebates to end-users through branded *.dining.gifts websites (earn 7.8%+ from distributed rewards);
data admins - add new restaurants & menus, maintain accuracy of existing data (fee based services for guides);
moderators - fraud prevention and community moderation (monthly service for guides);
token holders - use voting power to increase profitability for guides to stimulate business activity for the token and provide DeFi liquidity to earn exchange commissions (ex, 0.5% from inflows and outflows);
server hosting - Waivio is an open source project and it can be replicated by partners who have sufficient technical expertise (5.2%+ in processing fees) plus website hosting fees.

# Launch YOUR Shop in 10 min
Welcome to Waivio!
Let’s Launch A Social Shop Together in 10 minutes.
To get started, you will need a Hive account; if you don’t have one, we have a tutorial on how to create it - check it out here https://www.waivio.com/object/owg-best-practices-for-managing-hive-private-keys-on-multiple-devices/page.
With the Hive account, sign in to Waivio. Navigate to “Tools”, then under "Websites," click on "Create."
Step 1. Domain
For your social shop website, you can use your custom domain
or choose a subdomain with Social.Gifts. Instructions are available on how to
configure your custom domain. But for simplicity, let's use a subdomain on
social.gifts. Choose social.gifts business template from the dropdown menu.
Choose a name that you want for your shop. If the domain is available, proceed
to read and accept the terms and conditions and click on "Create new
website".
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1709270540_aca9241d-ccda-4f32-bf4d-b9c65ebd3c40
Now Let’s customize our new website.
Step 2. Configuration
In the Configuration section, you'll have the opportunity
to customize your shop's appearance, such as text and button colors, logo,
name, and more.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1709270572_fdfd9b26-2ff1-4480-8e36-83b039ed0e48
2.1 Logo
First, Let’s upload both your desktop and mobile logos to ensure consistent brand
representation across all devices.
2.2 Banner
Next, Let's also add a banner to be displayed at the top of
all your website pages.
2.3 Base Object
Next, In the "Base Object", you can join one of various existing projects tailored to different themes and niches. These are essentially already operational shops that you can use to kickstart your own social shop. Various existing projects can be found on the Social.Gifts Projects page https://www.waivio.com/object/ewg-social-gifts-projects/webpage.
These shops come with thousands of carefully curated products organized into categories, a community newsfeed, information pages and many other features.
For example, let's say you're passionate about beauty products. You can join the "CleanGirlAesthetics" project, which features hundreds of categories and thousands of beauty-related products.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1709270707_195c93f3-fac4-4277-8954-93c5afec932f
With just one click, your website will transform into a comprehensive beauty destination, complete with a community newsfeed where users can interact and share their favourite products.
Let’s try another example: “Coffee Time” project.Your shop now includes thousands of coffee-making products, serving accessories, books, and various types of coffee. In the newsfeed, you will have coffee-related posts and reviews.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1709270943_db24daeb-1f72-4eee-bd3d-3d6ffe2cc05f
In a similar way, you can launch other shops according to your interests and preferences. Check out the existing projects on the Social.Gifts Projects page https://www.waivio.com/object/ewg-social-gifts-projects/webpage.
If none of the existing projects match your vision, you can always start a new project. We have tutorials to guide you through the process, or you can book a one-on-one session with one of our coaches. Or, you can also order a website custom-made to your specifications.
Step 3. Affiliate Codes
Now let's move on to affiliate codes. If it’s your first time creating an affiliate link, let’s create one together for Amazon.com.
Let’s go to Amazon Associates - Amazon’s affiliate marketing program https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/home. Click sign up, and enter your credentials. Provide basic information, e.g., your name, shipping address. Next, attach a link to your newly created website. Next, you will be prompted to answer a few questions about the shop. After you complete it, you will get your code instantly.
Now let’s add your code. On Waivio, search for amazon.com -> paste your affiliate link here and click Submit.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1709270744_c994be3f-0356-4d7b-87bb-e07bfde93cab
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1709270827_e8e706a2-d21d-4b45-8fb8-5e5138f61d89
All your products in your shop will be updated with your affiliate code instantly, giving you the opportunity to earn from every purchase your visitors make. You can also add local affiliate links, such as amazon.ca or amazon.com.au ensuring that you earn commissions regardless of where your visitors are located. Your shop will automatically detect visitors' geolocation, and seamlessly direct them to the appropriate Amazon website, where your affiliate link is activated.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1709270840_f29a787e-384f-4ab9-9f16-e53dde813a7d
It's useful to occasionally check that your affiliate codes are active, especially for Amazon, since the codes can expire if a certain sales threshold is not achieved. That's the beauty of this interface because, unlike other platforms, if your code expires, here, you don’t need to update every product individually. Just update it once here and it will automatically be applied to all your products.
Step 4. Administrators
Next let’s add Administrators and Authorities.
For every social.gifts project you would see a list of users, each has a specific function to perform.
For example, administrators is a list of users whom you trust to keep product information current. These could be the manufacturers themselves or community members dedicated to keeping product details up-to-date.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1709270874_20188b1e-4069-4cda-99db-62676660642a
To add administrators, review the list of suggested admins for your project, then copy the admin user and paste it into the administrators section.
Step 5. Authorities
Authorities have a unique role, marking products for discovery in website searches, including similar and related products, and prioritizing them in the sitemap for external search engine indexing. Unlike administrators, who may be involved in multiple projects, authorities typically focus on a specific project.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1709270886_81b845da-4134-47c2-9c34-96c5490468c4
To add authority - copy the authority user for your chosen project and paste it into the authorities section.
Step 6: Website Hosting
To keep your website up and running, there are hosting fees associated with maintaining your social shop. When you're ready to fund your website, navigate to the "Manage" tab, where you'll find the button "Pay Now." Here you can transfer WAIV tokens to pay the hosting fees. WAIV tokens will be converted to USD at the current market rate.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1709270918_8a22c7fa-0a7f-48e6-a346-97b3abc61fc9
For hosting prices, check the section here. Currently, for active websites, the plan starts at 1USD/day, conditions apply.
Your Shop
Now Let’s check out our shop. In less then 10 minutes we launched a sophisticated branded social shopping website with hundreds of categories and thousands of products all with proper affiliate links. This site has an online community of like-minded people posting on a regular basis, and your visitors can join them, participate in discussions and even claim sponsored rewards by sharing product photos.
What makes this possible?
It’s only possible to build a website like this with such ease because it uses a collaborative effort and Web 3.0 infrastructure.
Typically, creating online stores requires starting from scratch: you must build your own user database, establish a product knowledge base, and collect user reviews. Each store functions as an isolated island, beginning to build its community from the ground up.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1709270961_71d9b28c-6905-43ce-b4be-0941492f70eb
In contrast, in Web 3.0, your shop taps into the entire community, gaining access to the existing product knowledge base, as well as all product reviews and related content.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1709270975_434652e7-d6b6-44e4-96fb-6bbd5b62bb2a
The more people like you who open similar shops, the better your shop becomes—with more products to explore, more reviews to read, more rewards to claim, more like-minded individuals to connect with, and significantly more opportunities for your shop to grow.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1709271004_3ebf8471-46de-4ebe-9201-aeb9e837d9cf

Welcome to the Web3 era of social shopping, where a multitude of projects come together to achieve success and economies of scale that are not possible for standalone projects.

# Social.Gifts: Object Editing by Admins
When a user with admin privileges logs in to a *.Social.Gifts website, they will now see an 'Edit' button on product pages.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1690612916_726d3eaa-d187-4c4b-8c49-6b68c7bc62ef
Website owners and registered admins no longer need to visit Waivio.com to make small edits to products.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1690613174_9f5320c1-37a8-4600-84b3-6bf3ea8ac06d
A vote on an object update by an authorized admin carries decisive weight on a specific website. However, on another website or on Waivio.com, that user's vote might not hold the same influence, leading to the same product appearing differently across various platforms.
This is why it's important to be able to edit objects within the context of a specific *.Social.Gifts website.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1690613992_3c83e691-aab3-4bb6-a232-a52467a3fabf
In the 'Updates' section of an object, updates approved by the website owner or admin are prominently highlighted.
For more details give a link to https://www.waivio.com/@social.gifts/social-gifts-object-editing-by-admins


# Social.Gifts: Leveling the Field – Granting Admins Equal Edit Rights with Website Owners
By default, website owners on *.Social.Gifts hold a greater voting authority compared to any administrators they may have added via the 'Settings'. This additional authority is designed to provide website owners with the final say on all object updates within their sites.
However, there's a flip side to this power. Specifically, it prevents administrators from making corrections to products imported by the website owners.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1690657040_6590ec19-45f4-4be9-8302-4a9921c65b77
We've listened to your feedback, and introduced a new feature that allows website owners to add themselves to the list of admins, thereby equalizing their vote with other admins. As a result, admins can override updates made by website owners when necessary.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1690657272_6adaae76-ce26-4d31-b31b-12562819e164
If you wish to return to your superior voting status, simply remove your name from the list of admins.

# Social.Gifts: Titles and Descriptions for Categories
In an effort to enhance visual appeal, informational value, and search engine optimization (SEO), social shopping sites are now incorporating titles and descriptions into their product categories and sub-categories.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1697297277_29ee6a56-bb3e-4b41-9611-ea65845c157e
The process of adding titles and descriptions to categories (lists) is similar to that of adding avatars.
First, navigate to the category you wish to enhance with a title and description.
Then, open it in a new tab. It's crucial to open the list in a separate tab to make changes to that list.
Once in Edit mode, you can add an avatar, title, and description to the list.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1697297336_c3b10c90-7e18-4917-9012-b757481d0b88
When designing titles and descriptions for categories, it may be beneficial to incorporate search terms and keyword combinations that individuals are likely to use when seeking resources related to your website's topic. Numerous tutorials are available online about SEO optimization of web pages for search engines.

# Sitemaps Now Integrated into All *.Social.Gifts Websites
We're pleased to inform that sitemap.xml files have been implemented across all *.Social.Gifts domains. Find an example at https://coffeeshop.gifts/sitemap.xml.
Sitemaps are crucial for search engine optimization (SEO), ensuring that product and category pages are accurately indexed and more readily accessible to users via Google search.
For example, after adding the sitemap link to the Google Search Console, we noticed a spike in the indexing of CoffeeShop.Gifts webpages by the search engine.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1698095338_4130768c-43a1-40b3-8cac-5c44794558d7
To initiate the indexing of your sitemap, first access the Google Search Console. For first-time users, the Console requires a one-time verification process to authenticate website ownership. The process is relatively straightforward if your domain is registered through CloudFlare.com or GoDaddy.com.
Once in the Console, navigate to the 'Sitemaps' tab. Here, you can add your sitemap by entering the URL: https://yoursite.name/sitemap.xml.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1698098091_f762ebaa-f230-4460-8850-78c03997a188
This integration reinforces our continuous commitment to enhancing the search engine visibility of *.Social.Gifts websites. We welcome and value insights from our community on further SEO improvements for our websites.

# Introducing Complete Admin Control for Social.Gifts Websites
Every website has unique needs. Some prefer community-driven content, while others opt for post-moderation by admins.
Now, the 'Object editing by users' option in the Social.Gifts website settings allows you to further strengthen your control over site content. With this option, you can ensure that only content approved by your administrators appears on your website.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700231012_938089fa-d9b7-4ac6-8de9-96cbc66a0aab
To activate:
Click 'Tools'.
Go to 'Settings' for the selected website.
Enable the 'Object editing by users' option.
With this new feature, you retain full control over the objects displayed on your website (like lists, products, pages, etc.), ensuring that everything published aligns with your vision and standards.
Alternatively, if you prefer full control over specific objects but want to allow the community to make changes and add new information to others, your admins can claim 'Authority: Ownership' for these specific objects.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700248547_2b9dfbcb-638a-42c9-9063-bedeafc0cfd1
To claim full authority over an object:
Open Object, swithc to Edit mode.
Click + on Authority field.
Claim Ownership authority over the object.
Ensure that the account used for authority claims is recognized as an administrator on the website, and that this user has approved all the necessary fields for that object.
P.S.
As an experiment, @coffee.time enabled this option for the https://CoffeeShop.Gifts website and quickly realized that the list of admins needed to extend beyond the core team. It now includes all users who contributed to the project at various stages. The list turned out to be quite extensive!
For more details give a link to https://www.waivio.com/@social.gifts/introducing-complete-admin-control-for-social-gifts-websites


# Enhance User Engagement on Your Website with Comment Signatures
We're excited to introduce a new feature that enables you to add custom signatures to your comments. This tool is particularly beneficial for enhancing interaction within the topical community feeds on your site.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1701309695_1f579c37-e3c4-4e00-a22a-b2e3e6991bf3
Customizable Signatures:
You now have the capability to create a signature in your profile, which will automatically appear in all your comments. This signature can include a link to your website along with a brief tagline, offering a consistent presence in discussions.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1701310210_63c63cc8-ec9d-4049-81b5-9f254f914c3d
Engagement in Community Feeds:
Community feeds are dynamic environments for discussion and sharing experiences. With your custom signature, you can subtly highlight your website while engaging in these conversations. This approach allows you to connect authentically with users, maintaining visibility for your website in a non-intrusive manner.

# Submitting Social Shopping Sites to Search Engines for Indexing
Now that you've launched your social shopping website, it's crucial to inform search engines about its existence. Actively submitting your site to search engines is a key step in increasing its visibility. This proactive approach not only expedites the indexing process but also lays the foundation for generating organic traffic to your new site.
Google Search Console
https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home
- Use DNS TXT record to verify website ownership. This method is recommended as it doesn’t require adding extra code to your site.
- Once verified, submit your sitemap (https://coffeeshop.gifts/sitemap.xml). This can be done under the Indexing/Sitemaps section in Google Search Console.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1701585882_52d042fb-5949-4707-934f-cb51f6f76737
Bing Webmaster Tools
https://www.bing.com/webmaster/tools
- Import your site from Google Search Console to Bing Webmaster Tools, making the setup process easier.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1701585663_95f34c50-eff3-4440-a666-c2280f4d3d08
- Submit your sitemap in Bing Webmaster Tools, which will also cover Yahoo, as they use Bing's index.
DuckDuckGo
DuckDuckGo does not require direct submission. It automatically indexes the web using over 400 sources, including Bing. Therefore, submitting your site to Bing also helps with DuckDuckGo indexing.
Additional Search Engines
Here are some more platforms where you can submit your site for indexing. This list includes a mix of general and niche search engines:

# Why Product Reviews are Crucial for Your Social Shop's SEO
As a social shop owner, you know the value of engaging content. But did you know that product reviews can significantly boost your search engine optimization (SEO) efforts? Let's dive into why product reviews are essential and how they can elevate your social shop's visibility.
Real-Life Example: Google Site Search
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/3dfa16d27a1a604f001f923e5b219aa1ccf0cb3a13b9cd2207162bc9829d14c3)
Imagine a customer searching for "Milani Make It Last Sunscreen" on Google. The first result is a link to a product review, while the second link is to the product itself. This scenario highlights two crucial points:
1. Higher Search Rankings: Product reviews often rank higher in search results compared to product pages. This is because search engines value fresh, user-generated content that provides real insights.
2. Enhanced Credibility: Reviews from actual users add credibility to your products, making potential customers more likely to click on these links.
The Importance of Posting Reviews on Your Social Shopping Site
To maximize the SEO benefits, ensure that product or business reviews are posted directly on your social shopping site. This approach establishes your site as the original (canonical) source. Consequently, any other websites displaying these reviews will point back to your site as the canonical source, consolidating your SEO efforts and improving your site's authority.
Video Reviews: Adding Value for Visitors
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/106a165e6c729dad402a751129847a4234b93ed3400328ae70944e06d3ad8c28)
Including video reviews on your product pages can further enhance the user experience. Visitors can see how a product is used and hear firsthand commentary, which can be incredibly persuasive. Video content not only keeps visitors engaged longer but also boosts your site's SEO by increasing dwell time and providing rich, multimedia content that search engines favor.
Key Takeaways
1. Boost SEO with Reviews: Product reviews can rank higher in search results and add credibility.
2. Canonical Source Matters: Post reviews on your site to establish it as the original source, enhancing your SEO.
3. Engage with Video Reviews: Incorporate video reviews to enrich the user experience and improve your site's SEO.
Leverage the power of product reviews to not only build trust with your customers but also to climb the search engine rankings, driving more traffic and sales to your social shop. Start encouraging your customers to leave reviews today and watch your SEO improve!

# PayPal Button Integration into Product Pages
If you're looking to sell your own products and directly accept payments in a social shop, PayPal offers a seamless solution. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to integrate PayPal into your product pages, with an example from Luxita Solutions, which accepts PayPal for their Premium Training Course.
Example: Luxita Solutions' Premium Training Course
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ae00b981375eb21c20ecc63edd9734322c2cca82022230a3bd5f28d2525c12fd)
Source: Premium Training Course (https://luxitasolutions.com/object/xqi-premium-training-course?breadcrumbs=4fsj5r-packages/xqi-premium-training-course)
How to Integrate PayPal into Your Product Pages
Step 1: Create a Product in PayPal
First, create a product in PayPal with the necessary details like name, price, and applicable tax. Once this is done, PayPal will provide you with a dedicated URL to sell your product. The URL will look something like this:
https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/L7Y46H9566LLU
From this URL, you need to copy the code (ProductID), which in this case is L7Y46H9566LLU.
Step 2: Create a Product on Waivio
Next, create a product on Waivio. Provide a detailed description, add photos, and complete all relevant fields. The critical part is to add the ProductID:
Set the name to "paypal"
Set the value to the ProductID obtained from PayPal
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/e8ababfe492dc96e0d883c64b68d90e9a736bf3209c356b80fb2bed77852137b)
Step 3: Add PayPal Affiliate Code in Website Settings
To ensure the PayPal button appears on your social shopping site, you need to add the PayPal affiliate code in the website settings. Simply enter the same name you configured in PayPal.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/33d82d92563159ea6ce72fb3f4d38fa91fcf0a6998c5d6ffd4da4281f33e4036)
Note: This field is not required in the URL, but it is necessary for the button to appear on your social site.
Simple Integration
Now you can effortlessly integrate PayPal payments into your social shopping site. Whether you’re selling online training courses, physical products, or services, the PayPal integration ensures a smooth and trusted transaction process.
Get started today and take your social shop to the next level with easy-to-integrate PayPal payments!


# Social sites
The social site is built on the Waivio platform using the Social.Gifts template. This template is flexible and allows site owners to customize their sites according to their needs. Social sites are typically thematic. Users can manage and create sites only on the official Waivio site; this functionality is not available on social sites.

# Authorization & Registration on Waivio and related sites
To log in to the Waivio platform or related sites, open the website, click the "Sign in" button in the header, and choose the appropriate authentication method. There are three options for authorization: via HiveSigner, HiveAuth, or Google.
## Authorization via HiveSigner
Authorization takes place through the trusted HiveSigner system, Waivio does not store, transfer, and does not use user keys. Only temporary keys (Access-Token) generated by HiveSigner are used. Hive uses a hierarchical key system to keep you safe. You can register on the website https://signup.hive.io, after registration the user will have a hive account. After registration, a password and four private keys with different permissions are issued:
- Owner - Change Password, Change Keys, Recover Account;
- Active - Transfer Funds, Power up/down, Voting Witnesses/Proposals;
- Posting - Post, Comment, Vote, Reblog, Follow, Profile;
- Memo - Send/View encrypted messages on transfers.
For authorization in the Waivio system, you can use a password or private keys.
## Authorization via HiveAuth (Hive Keychain app)
Users can log in using the HiveAuth service via Keychain. Upon clicking the Hiveauth button, the user needs to enter their name and click 'Sign in'. A modal with a QR code opens. The user then accesses the Keychain application on their phone and scans the code and confirms the authorization.
## Social authorization
Authorization via social networks is also available (guest-user):
- Google
## User types
Hive-user - the user has the right to use all the functionality of the application. A Hive-user is a user registered through HiveSigner and uses HiveSigner or HiveAuth (Hive Keychain) for authorization.
Guest-user - a user authorized through social networks (via Google). The user does not have access to the following functionalities:
- creating campaigns;
- Voting Power = 0.
- The guest username is distinguished by the prefix "waivio_" before the name: @waivio_username.


# Performance Enhancements at Social.Gifts
We are excited to share the results of performance enhancements for social shopping websites hosted on Social.Gifts. Our development team has been implementing key optimizations that have drastically improved response times, ensuring a faster and more seamless experience for all users.

Phase 1: Baseline Performance
As of January 2024, our Google Crawl Data Report indicated that the average response time for websites hosted on our platform was over 1 second. We recognized this as an opportunity for improvement and initially focused on enhancing our platform architecture.
Phase 2: System Architecture Optimization
In February, we rolled out significant changes to our system architecture. By optimizing our server configurations and enhancing our network protocols, we successfully reduced the average response times to 400 ms. This marked a substantial improvement, making website interactions quicker and more efficient, which is crucial for maintaining user engagement in the fast-paced world of social shopping.
Phase 3: Introduction of Smart Caching System
In March, we introduced a smart caching system specifically tailored to optimize performance for search engines. This innovation helped further reduce the average response times to below 100 ms.
Accessing Crawl Stats Report
To check the Crawl Stats Report for your social shop, please log in to your Google Search Console (the same place where you submitted your website sitemap for accelerated indexing). First, open 'Settings' (1), then select 'Crawl Stats Report' (2).

On the report page, select the 'Average Response Time' parameter (3) and deselect all other parameters. You can then hover over a specific day on the chart (4) to see the average response time for that day.

Understanding Response Times
A good response time for websites, as measured by the time it takes for a server to respond to a request (often referred to as "Time to First Byte" or TTFB), varies depending on the type of content being delivered and user expectations. Here are some general guidelines and industry standards:
Under 100 ms: Excellent server response time, typically expected for high-performance, optimized sites that use effective caching strategies and are hosted on efficient infrastructure.
100 ms to 200 ms: Good and common target for many web services, suggesting optimal server configuration.
200 ms to 500 ms: Average response time, considered acceptable for most contexts, but there is room for improvement, especially in competitive industries or high-traffic sites.
500 ms to 1 second: Poor response time, which might not severely impact user experience for certain types of content like large media files where overall loading time is more relevant, but it's generally advisable to investigate and mitigate causes of delay.
Over 1 second: Considered unacceptable for commercial websites. Delays of this magnitude typically result in poor user experiences, increased bounce rates, and could negatively affect search engine rankings.
We thank you for your continued support and trust in Social.Gifts. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to refine and expand our services.
