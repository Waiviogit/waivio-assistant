# Tools / Notifications
**Notification Settings** - This page allows users to configure notifications. Notifications from active checkboxes will be sent to both the notification bell and the bot's Telegram account.
By default, almost all checkboxes are active. When changing the state of a notification checkbox, users should click the "Save" button to apply the new settings.

# Lesson 3: Customizing Your Profile
For more details give a link to https://social.gifts/object/cww-customizing-your-hive-profile/page
Now, that you created your Hive account and signed in for the first time, let's customize your profile on Waivio and publish your first post on the Hive social blockchain.

1. Notifications
First, Sign in to Waivio with your Hive account. Upon logging in, you'll notice that your profile lacks a logo or any personalization. You also probably don’t have any activity on your feed, as you are not following anyone yet. But before we proceed with customizing your profile, it's important to set up notifications to ensure you receive critical announcements, this enhances the security of your account.
Navigate to Tools and click on @WaivioNotificationsBot https://t.me/WaivioNotificationsBot
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713154960_3f7935e8-5199-4b25-a5f5-f681b1ffcf35)
It will direct you to a Telegram bot. Click on "Send Message", which will then redirect you to a telegram chat. If you don't have Telegram, you can install it with this link: https://desktop.telegram.org/ ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713155014_b5803675-7304-4944-8ca4-5579af786809)
In the Telegram chat, click start and then enter your Hive username; for example, I will enter mine - cleobaby. You will be all set to receive important notifications. If you have multiple Hive accounts, you can add all of them to the same bot chat. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713155202_10a15c88-02c8-4bd9-b623-1f6c5cdbb19c)
Next, we can configure the notifications you wish to receive; the default ones include LIKES, REBLOGS, REPLIES, MENTIONS, FOLLOW, STATUS CHANGED, ACTIVATION CAMPAIGN, and all the wallet transactions; you can turn these notifications ON or OFF.
Also there are security alerts such as outgoing transfers, withdrawals and so on - these are always on to ensure the safety of your account.

2. Edit Profile
Next, let's set up your profile. On the side menu, choose "Edit Profile." Here, you can change your name, add "about me, information " add your country, or email if you want—but keep in mind that this information will be public, so don't include anything sensitive like your home address.
Then, add your website—for example, if you are a shop owner, you can add your link here. I have a CleoBaby social shop, so I will add my link; if you want to learn how to create a beautiful shop yourself in under 10 minutes, check out this tutorial. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713156934_1c3cee01-d1d2-47e1-b5e3-38ec4e6b1200)
Next, let's upload your avatar. Click “Upload” and choose an image from your computer. Then, let's also add a cover image.
You can also add your social network accounts, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram, GitHub, and even your public Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet addresses.
Finally, let's also add a signature. This functions the same as the email signature—whenever you make a comment on a post or reply to a comment, it will automatically be added. For example, shop owners can add their link here. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713155391_57c5c688-8e70-4d9a-adc8-81011ea6f97a) ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713155495_bd6d4061-ad10-41e8-997c-2090dada137b)

3. Settings
Let's move on to Settings. Here, you can choose an interface language for navigating Waivio.
You can also select content languages—this determines what posts will be shown in your thread. For example, the default one is English but if you also add Spanish, you will see posts in both English and Spanish. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713155629_a4957332-e8f3-4012-8578-c68f50162a09)
Next, select the currency you prefer for viewing your rewards and earnings.
Then, you have an option to turn on or off NSFW (Not Safe for Work) posts.
You can also choose to turn on the night mode. There are a few other more advanced settings too.

Voting Power (Mana)
Now, let's discuss voting power (mana). When you possess WAIV and HIVE power, you gain voting power, which can be used to upvote posts and comments. Casting a vote on other users' posts reduces your voting power, meaning each vote decreases your voting power. However, this reduction is temporary, as your voting power recharges by 20% each day. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713155689_13f79de5-d425-4808-a52f-9dd05da7d2a1)
By actively participating in the community through voting and curating posts, you earn curation rewards proportional to your vote value. For more details, please check the "About Waivio" https://social.gifts/object/cww-customizing-your-hive-profile/page#oal-about-waivio video.
Using the slider, you can choose the percentage of your vote allocation. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713155823_18cf6ee8-0fa7-42dc-bc87-0d365372f22f)
If you select 100%, each time you vote on a post, your vote value will decrease by 2%. For example, if your vote value is $1, after a one 100% vote, it will be $0.98. But if you choose 1% - it will be $0.998.
Thus, you can sustainably make 10 votes of 100%, 20 votes of 50%, or 100 votes of 1% daily. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713155885_726e5a58-ba32-4ff9-a831-f05a79225aa6)
I don't recommend choosing lower than 50% unless you curate a lot of posts. Remember, your vote value recharges every day by 20%, so if you make 10 votes of 100% a day (and your vote value falls from $1 to 80 cents), the next day your vote will recharge back to $1. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713155967_c8881022-5e70-488c-b1f8-08d0cb074ce3)
If you prefer to adjust the percentage allocation for each post individually, ensure that the "enable slider" option is activated. Otherwise, you can "disable slider", and your chosen percentage will be applied every time you vote. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713156220_bf2960b6-82c9-4c82-822e-3f66f157212d)
When you have made changes to the settings, make sure to click Save.

4. Affiliate Codes

# Lesson 4: Managing Your Wallet
For more details give a link to https://social.gifts/object/axy-your-waivio-wallet/page
In this tutorial, you will explore the Wallet section of Waivio and receive a step-by-step guide on how to deposit funds into your Waivio account.
You will learn how to deposit funds on Waivio to kickstart your social shop, understand the differences between liquid WAIV, WAIV Power, and HIVE Power, and discover how to swap, delegate, and withdraw cryptocurrencies.
Overview:
1. Wallet Overview: WAIV, HIVE, Hive Engine.
2. Wallet Management:
     - Transferring Funds;
     - Powering Up;
     - Powering Down;
     - Managing Delegations;
     - Executing Token Swaps;
     - Making Deposits;
     - Processing Withdrawals.
3. A Step-by-Step Walkthrough to Depositing Funds.

WAIV Wallet
The first section here is "WAIV" assets. These include liquid WAIV and WAIV Power.
Liquid WAIV is the main currency on Waivio. You can use it to pay for social shopping website hosting, buy VIP tickets for new HIVE accounts, and other services. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706847600_eb3566c3-3de3-48a5-a0d6-ef09bc020b9d)
WAIV Power is your voting power on Waivio. You need it to vote on posts and comments, which enhances your presence and authority. WAIV Power is also needed for creating objects and importing products for your social shop. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706847612_9e292c1b-c237-481b-bf8d-eea1531c0866)
You will also receive rewards for your posts and reviews in liquid WAIV tokens. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706847628_a11eb84d-5bc3-45b5-990c-f9e1662e720c)
To convert liquid WAIV to WAIV Power, click "Power up," and staking is done instantly.
To convert WAIV Power to liquid WAIV, click "Power down." Keep in mind, powering down takes 4 weeks, with funds released every week in equal amounts.

HIVE Wallet
Now, let's look at the "HIVE" assets. Here you will find liquid HIVE, HIVE Power (HP), and HIVE-backed dollars (HBD).
HIVE is the main token on the Hive blockchain, and having HIVE Power (specifically Resource Credits) is essential for doing anything on the blockchain, from sending payments to writing posts. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706847508_30a50fe4-abc6-4620-882c-9cab1040a267)
You might receive Hive Power and Hive-Backed Dollars as rewards for your posts. If you are interested in learning more about the rewards, check out the About Waivio video https://social.gifts/object/axy-your-waivio-wallet/page#6vcmab-tutorials/oal-about-waivio.
To convert liquid Hive to Hive Power, click "Power up," and it happens instantly.
To convert Hive Power to liquid Hive, click “Power down.” For Hive Power, powering down takes 13 weeks, with funds being released weekly.

Hive Engine Wallet
Here, you will find all the other tokens available on the Hive blockchain. This includes wrapped tokens such as swap.BTC and swap.ETH, as well as various other tokens used within the Hive ecosystem.
Rebalancing
There's also a Rebalancing section, which is a strategy to grow your crypto holdings. To learn more, make sure to check out our comprehensive article on it https://social.gifts/object/wxu-rebalancing-introduction/page.

2. Wallet Management
Next, on the right panel, you'll find:

Transfer
Use this if you want to send crypto to another Hive user.

Power up
Here, you can power up not only liquid WAIV or liquid HIVE but also other tokens you have on the Hive blockchain.

Power down
Here, you can power down not just Waiv POWER or HIVE POWER but also other powered-up tokens you own.

Manage Delegations
Here, you can lend your WAIV Power, HIVE Power, and more powered-up tokens to other Hive users. Choose the token you want to delegate, then a user, and an amount. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706848130_571888f0-116a-44a6-89a8-82fcb0f5c261)
The delegation happens instantly. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706848144_ec68f5e3-6873-4bdb-9ad8-c0344dc0d377)
If you decide to undelegate, click edit. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706848161_0c7cc536-7ba4-419e-9b4b-6b311da25ccf)
It's important to note that it will take 7 days for the funds to be returned to your account. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706848336_d601b0b1-d3db-4959-85c1-06d3ac3ecbe4)
After you've delegated tokens, the delegated amount will be displayed as a negative balance in parenthesis, next to the respective token. You can click on it to view more details. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706848296_d72ced42-52cb-45fa-a818-87714c27d1e8)

Swap Tokens
This is for converting one token into another (such as swap.BTC to WAIV or swap.HIVE to swap.LTC).
You can also conveniently swap any token into liquid WAIV in the Hive Engine section by clicking “Swap to WAIV” next to the appropriate token. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706847804_19b9786c-8ab9-4d4f-b0a3-4b8e1aed19c5)

Deposit
This is for depositing funds (e.g., BTC) into your wallet.

Withdraw
This is to withdraw funds and transfer it to other wallets and blockchains, such as back to your Bitcoin wallet.
You can also do this conveniently in the Hive Engine section by clicking the dropdown menu next to the desired token and selecting "Withdraw to ___." ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706847827_8565df07-bdfd-4e37-bb04-397ccd7fcca7)

3. A Step-by-Step Walkthrough to Depositing Funds
Now Let me walk you through the entire process of depositing funds on Waivio.
To deposit funds on Waivio, you'll need some cryptocurrency. Here, is the list of cryptocurrencies you can deposit:
BLURT (BLURT), Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Dogecoin (DOGE), HBD (HBD), Litecoin (LTC), SAVVA (SAVVA), SBD (SBD), STEEM (STEEM), SwiftCash (SWIFT), TELOS (TLOS)
The most up-to-date list is available in the "Deposit" window.
If you don't have anything on the list, you can easily buy it on exchanges. Users in the US and Europe might consider using Coinbase.com, while Canadian users may prefer Newton.co.
Click on "Deposit" (located on the side panel in Wallet), Choose the cryptocurrency you wish to deposit. In this example, Bitcoin will be used, but you can use any cryptocurrency from the list.
After selecting BTC, you'll see a BTC wallet address and a QR code.
For example, in the image below is my BTC deposit address on the Hive Engine. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706847918_72d5d789-debc-41ed-8744-6094ef83ee35)
Copy & Paste the wallet address or scan the QR code to send funds; I recommend first testing it out with 10 dollars. You can monitor the transaction on a blockchain explorer. After the transaction is successful, you can send more funds.
To kickstart your social shop on Waivio, I recommend depositing around $400.
Once the transaction is complete, you'll see your funds in the swap.BTC wallet in the "Hive Engine" section. With just one click on the "SWAP to WAIV" button, you can convert your BTC holdings into liquid WAIV tokens. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706847963_075beeb9-3d58-4ce1-b8c6-7c61795b234b)
To make the most of the platform, I recommend a ratio of 1 liquid WAIV to 2 WAIV Power and a little bit of Hive Power. Since you already have liquid WAIV, getting WAIV Power and HIVE Power from it is straightforward. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706847975_63a33119-0a9e-4ae9-814d-8553eadbb4bc)
To convert liquid WAIV to WAIV Power, go to the WAIV section and click "Power Up." Choose the amount you want to power up (suggested amount: $250) and click continue. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706847999_5a772f1b-8f9b-47ef-ac8e-6a0c87fa58cd)
For example, with a $250 investment, you will have a vote value of approximately $0.006, and you would be able to import around 15 products per day.
To convert liquid WAIV to Hive, click on the dropdown menu and choose "Withdraw to HIVE", select the amount (suggested amount: $50). ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706848022_f38f9864-e88f-480e-bc92-3163ca4b112f)
And now let's go to the Hive section, here you will see your liquid Hive. If not, then wait a little bit, it might take a few minutes for this transaction to complete, and the funds to appear in your wallet.
Click "Power Up" to convert liquid Hive to Hive Power. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706848037_cd6c9517-0b2f-4bb2-954a-0e3488516ad5)
Now, you're all set and can start using Waivio and the Hive Blockchain to its fullest, whether it's writing posts, sending funds, participating in sponsored rewards, building your social shop, and much more. For example, you can already begin building your dream social shop by importing a few products with the Waivio Extension and adding funds to run your social shop.

Here, you can display products that resonate with your interests and provide a lot of value for your target audience. And with every purchase originating from your shop, you'll receive affiliate commissions from merchants. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1697489190_6653e50b-80f7-4ff4-8f58-2640d5debb81)
 You can locate your SHOP on your user's page. It's time to add some products to it! ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1697489358_db2b4e7d-5f19-485a-970a-7be194cc00d0)

 Step 1: Adding a Product
 To start off, let's head over to Waivio's "SHOP" section. Take a look at different departments, like "Appliances," to find products that you can recommend to others. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1697490421_7bd9e905-3496-4139-aa15-0c6891fdba62)
 Let's say you know and like this fancy coffee maker – simply click the heart icon, and just like that it's added to your shop!
 Now, here's the beauty: if the item you've added gets updated, you don't need to worry about manual adjustments. Your shop will automatically reflect these changes - no additional action is required on your part. Your shop effortlessly stays up-to-date, showcasing your thoughtfully chosen selections.

 Step 2: Various Ways to Find and Add Products
 Let me now show you some more ways to discover products and enrich your shop's collection.
 Search: If you have a specific product in mind, search for it on Waivio and if it’s already available on the Hive blockchain, quickly add it to your shop.
 Explore Other Users' Shops: Check out what fellow curators are featuring in their shops. If you spot something you like, hit that heart button to add it to your shop.
 Product Links in Posts: Keep an eye out for products mentioned in posts. You can easily add them to your shop; just scroll down to the end of the post, where you will see linked products and click the heart.
 Adding Products from Amazon: If a product can't be found on the Hive blockchain, you can effortlessly import it from the Amazon page with a single click using Waivio's Chrome extension. Check out the tutorial on the extension for more details.

 Step 3: Adding Affiliate Codes
 Now that your shop is coming together, it's time to monetize your product collections.
 Navigate to "TOOLS" and select "Affiliate codes."
 In the search bar, find your affiliate program. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1697490481_7870d303-6bbd-4b69-8853-1e7592ade5da)
 If you're part of Amazon's affiliate program, choose the local Amazon shop where you are an affiliate, such as amazon.com, amazon.ca or amazon.fr.
 If you are not sure how to get your Amazon affiliate code, check this link:
 https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/node/topic/GCE3F2NCVZLDFM6A
 For example, let's say you have affiliate code for Amazon.com. Choose amazon.com from the menu. Input your respective affiliate code in the designated field and click "Submit." ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1697490500_606e7506-50e3-4e1f-8119-5371f102bc01)
 This will automatically associate your affiliate code with the 'buy' buttons for all the products in your shop, ensuring you earn commissions with every purchase.

 Step 4: Linking products in your posts

 Furthermore, products you reference will be automatically added to your profile shop. To remove a product from your shop, simply click the heart icon twice (first to add the product, then to remove it).
 In the user settings, there's also an option to prevent products from being added to your profile unless they are explicitly marked with a heart. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1697490535_6c234bfb-4b58-431c-ac8a-c4143764a674)

![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1626239596_e3ffec00-70d0-4cff-a178-9fc40346b60d

# Waivio wallet now supports Hive-Engine tokens
Waivio users can earn rewards in multiple tokens for their posts, comments and upvotes, including WAIV, HIVE and other community tokens on the Hive-Engine sidechain.
Waivio makes it easy for users to track their account balance, earnings and transaction history separately for WAIV token, HIVE and all other Hive-Engine tokens in three dedicated wallet tabs (1).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1655577714_18d57f92-eee4-4a15-a47f-9fa8b0bbb9eb
With the wide variety of tokens, Waivio wallet now supports instant swaps (2) between different tokens via decentralized diesel pools (DeFi) on the Hive Engine blockchain. One of the main advantages of these pools is the low BUY/SELL spreads of only 0.25%.
For example, you may easily swap WAIV tokens into SWAP.HIVE (pegged HIVE token on Hive-Engine, which can be instantly withdrawn into HIVE):
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1655580922_ae20c8bc-cc54-4490-9a8e-c614bfd940b4
All wallet operations must be confirmed with an active key using HiveSigner, which ensures that your private keys are stored securely (encrypted) in your browser and never shared with applications.
The Waivio wallet also allows users to deposit and withdraw all major cryptocurrencies (3), including BTC, LTC, EOS, ETH, DOGE, HIVE, HBD, and others directly via Hive-Engine gateways paying a small fee of 0.75%.
As a next step you can, for example, withdraw SWAP.HIVE to HIVE:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1655581196_226a8966-8fb1-4428-81ec-5646f1deca80
When withdrawing other currencies, such as BTC, LTC, ETH, you can scan the destination QR code, which can contain not only information about the destination address, but also the required amount. Waivio wallet automatically calculates all transfer fees and suggests the amount of the corresponding SWAP.xxx token that should be transferred.
For example, if you initiate a withdrawal of $20 worth of LTC via a Bitcoin ATM, you simply scan the QR code on the ATM and Waivio wallet will do the rest:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1655582579_9863e5a0-cb90-4553-9df2-e7ac30d9a27f
You can enjoy the same convenience when paying for your coffee or any other product or service with all major cryptocurrencies directly from your Hive-Engine wallet.
Future development
In order to simplify things even further, the wallet may even combine swap and withdraw thransactions into a single step. This way users may keep their funds in liquid WAIV tokens and pay bills in BTC, LTC, ETH, EOS and other major currencies in one click.
Waivio wallet will find the optimal way to convert WAIV into the target currency, automatically calculate all commissions, slippages and fees. And users will just need to confirm the transaction.

# Get a clear picture of your WAIV and HIVE token earnings with Waivio
When you add a hashtag #waivio or #waiv to your posts, you make your post eligible to receive WAIV rewards in addition to HIVE rewards. Such posts are highlighted and marked with a Waivio logo:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1672790344_a7de4358-8472-4586-a674-2baca07de51a
By clicking on the total earnings, you can view further details such as the breakdown of earnings in WAIV, Hive Power, and HBD, as well as the beneficiaries and their share of the earnings. You can also see the total number of rewards received by all curators.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1672789744_5ad22ed0-d270-4c19-bf0d-fed356afa02c
One key difference between WAIV and HIVE earnings is that WAIV rewards are paid in liquid form, while HIVE earnings are paid as a 50/50 combination of Hive Power (HP) and HBD (there is also an option to receive 100% of HIVE rewards in HP). This means that you can immediately access and use your WAIV rewards, while HIVE rewards in the form of Hive Power must be converted to liquid HIVE through a 13 week power down period.
Waivio simplifies the process of exchanging your WAIV earnings for popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and HIVE. With just a few clicks, you can quickly convert your WAIV or pay directly for goods and services.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1672793376_70fb4080-f8de-4b23-8df6-c6467fb66824
All crypto conversions are performed on a decentralized exchange built on the second layer Hive-Engine blockchain.

# Introducing Public Favorites in User Profiles on Waivio
After the successful introduction of the public shop feature in user profiles (https://social.gifts/object/ylr-waivio/page#mim-transform-your-passion-into-profit-with-waivio/fjh-shops-in-user-profiles), many of you reached out with a fantastic suggestion: the ability to showcase your favorite businesses, restaurants, and places in a similar, personalized manner. We're excited to announce that we've made this idea a reality with the launch of the Favorites section in user profiles on Waivio!
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706909361_036aec2e-04d7-474b-ab58-ffde1eeb4640
How It Works:
Adding an item to your Favorites on the Hive blockchain is as simple as can be.
Whenever you find a spa, café, park, or any place that captures your heart, just hit the heart icon, and it will automatically be added to your Favorites section.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706911457_1a110756-46d3-4f96-8398-f463b536191d
Additionally, if you reference any business, restaurant, place, or page in your posts, Waivio will automatically add it to your Favorites section in your profile. This happens seamlessly, keeping your Favorites list fresh and up-to-date with your latest discoveries and recommendations. If you would like to remove it, you can toggle the heart icon on and off.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706912443_de1e2606-cf17-4907-8209-6774a20a890a
Start Sharing and Discovering:
With this update, your Waivio profile becomes an even more powerful tool for sharing and discovery. By simply posting about the places and businesses you love, you're creating a curated list of recommendations for your followers and the broader community. As you explore other users' content, you'll find new favorites among their shared experiences.
Future Developments:
We are exploring ways to make it easier to add businesses and other objects to the Hive blockchain. Our goal is for these entries to serve as a repository for accumulating knowledge and community reviews about experiences, destinations, and ideas (https://social.gifts/object/ylr-waivio/page#6vcmab-tutorials/jpv-accumulating-knowledge-on-hive).
Currently, you can utilize the Waivio Chrome Extension (https://social.gifts/object/ylr-waivio/page#mim-transform-your-passion-into-profit-with-waivio/kda-waivio-chrome-extension-tutorial) to add products from Amazon, Walmart, Sephora to the Hive blockchain with just one click. We're excited to announce that the latest version of the Extension now also supports the import of businesses and restaurants from OpenStreetMap.org.
Here at Waivio Labs, we are exploring a number of interesting applications of Web3 for building social shops and other themed social websites.

# Have you tried reporting HIVE income on your taxes?
Because if you did, you would know how frustrating and daugnting this task really is.
For starters, in many jursidictions income must be recorded when cryptocurrency is credited to the user account, rather than at the time of withdrawal and conversion into the local currency.
The next question is what exchange rate to use. Due to the high volatility of HIVE, averaging exchange rates in a way that would not cause a dispute with the tax authority might be challenging. The most transparent way to do it is to report each transaction using the daily exchange rate for both HIVE and HBD.
Withdrawals also should be calculated in a similar way. Even small payments and tips should be accounted for.
In order to solve this problem Waivio.com now offers advance reporting for Hive wallets:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1625204776_0d43e9db-5ac7-48e3-88a1-848feb6af31a
Each transaction in the report includes the daily exchange rates for both HIVE and HBD. Please note that for transactions before March 20, 2020 (date of the Hive hardfork), STEEM and SBD rates will be used instead.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1625205308_13c1a8ed-23bb-4dae-bd03-487410dc81c5
All transactions are divided into three groups: Deposits (D), Withdrawals (W), and Internal transactions, such as power ups or moving funds into and out of Savings.
Please specify the dates (from-till) to see the total amounts of deposits and withdrawals for the specified period. It may take some time to retrieve all the data.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1625206330_a2d13f64-fbb0-4b30-92f2-647e44547b69
If you want to exclude some transactions from the totals (e.g. deposit of own funds to the account or conversion of HBD to HIVE via an external exchange), please mark them using the checkboxes in the left column:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1625206869_26f38e1d-682a-4065-bd25-e4627ac80f05
These exceptions are automatically saved under the account you are currently logged into.
If you have multiple accounts on Hive, you can combine them all into one report. In this case, all transactions between the accounts will be recognized as internal and excluded from the calculation of total deposits and withdrawals.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1625207454_3d745094-9408-40ae-96b3-504c1980682c
Advanced financial reports can be generated in various currencies. At the time of this release, in addition to U.S. dollars, reports can also be generated in Canadian dollars using historical exchange rates as provided by the Bank of Canada.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1625207973_a2674b47-e5ec-4098-a22a-b603b5d48127
The advanced reports were developed at the request of Waivio partners for annual tax reporting, but we hope they can simplify tax reporting for many Hive users as well.

# Rebalancing: Simple strategy to grow your crypto holdings
Rebalancing is a simple but very effective strategy to continually increase the number of liquid tokens in your portfolio without delegating, staking, or freezing them in savings.
In fact, this strategy is so effective that you could have increased the number of liquid HIVE and HBD tokens by as much as 30% in the last year. And we're not talking about the dollar value of your crypto-assets, we're talking specifically about a 30% increase in the amount of tokens!
The strategy is so simple that it can be formulated in one sentence - keep the dollar value of both tokens at the same level.
That's it. That is the strategy.
Now let's see it in action
So, we start with two tokens in such a quantity that their dollar value is the same. For example, let's take $1,000 HIVE (2,000 tokens at $0.50 each) and $1,000 HBD (1,000 tokens at $1.00 each).
Now let's imagine that the price of HIVE has increased from $0.50 to $0.60.
We still have 2,000 HIVE, but at the new $0.60 rate, the value has increased to $1,200. The value of HBD remains the same at $1,000 (1,000 HBD at $1.00).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1658874659_daeb80ca-c19f-4946-bd90-93f9f7623b14
To rebalance the tokens, we need to exchange $100 HIVE for $100 HBD. After rebalancing, the portfolio will have $1,100 HIVE (1,833.33 at $0.60) and $1,100 HBD (1,100 at $1.00).
Next, let's imagine that the price of HIVE went back from $0.60 to $0.50.
In this case, the value of the portfolio would be $916.67 HIVE and $1,100 HBD.
Again, let's rebalance, but this time in the opposite direction: swap $91.67 HBD for $91.67 HIVE.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1658876673_17ffd8c9-0dbe-4034-8bbb-68ab1dd7e872
After the second rebalancing, there will be $1,008.34 HIVE (2,016.66 at $0.50) and $1,008.33 HBD (1,008.33 at $1.00).
In two transactions, we went from 2,000 HIVE to 2,016.66 HIVE (a 0.83% increase) and from 1,000 HBD to 1,008.33 HBD (also a 0.83% increase).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1658877352_c3351d62-122c-4bbb-9d38-b05795ed7fe0
You can either passively watch the prices of your favorite tokens change, or grow your portfolio every time there is a price change in either direction.
The past 48 hours
In the past 48 hours, the price of HIVE rose from $0.46 to $0.58 (+26%) before returning to $0.49 (-16%).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1658902294_4f34ba76-7e56-4a15-99ef-a77ed8b5ff40
With the right swap timing, you could have increased your HIVE/HBD portfolio by 0.50% - 1.00% in just one day.
Where does the profit come from?
Imagine yourself on a big cruise ship, and you have a long stick with an electric generator at the end of it that you can dip into the water and generate electricity while the cruise ship is in motion. Whether the ship is going forward or backward, your generator works equally well.
What happens is that you generate electricity (profit) by slowing down the cruise ship (open market) with your small generator (tokens in your wallet).
When you rebalance your wallet, you stabilize the open market.
Since the liquidity in your wallet is probably small compared to the open market, the overall market impact of your swaps will be negligible. But if the liquidity in your wallet reaches a size comparable to the open market, the stabilization effect will become noticeable.
Arbitrage vs. trading
Rebalancing can also be seen as arbitrage between the open market and your own wallet. While the ratio between tokens in the market is constantly changing, the ratio in your wallet remains unchanged. Thus, the price of one of your tokens will be higher than its current market value and the price of the other will be lower than its current market value.
The act of rebalancing is selling an overpriced token to buy an underpriced token.
The fundamental difference between arbitrage and trading is that each arbitrage transaction is profitable at the time of the transaction. Arbitrage matches the market without any prediction as to the future direction of the market. And if the market quickly changes in the opposite direction - great, you can rebalance in the opposite direction and make a profit again.
Arbitrage is a profitable and highly competitive business. But when you arbitrage between the market and your own wallet, you have exclusive rights to your own wallet.
And this is where rebalancing offers a unique advantage over the open market arbitrage.
Maximizing profits by chasing higher spreads
Since you have exclusive rights to rebalance your own wallet, you can delay rebalancing until the spread between your wallet and the open market ratios reaches a higher level.
The following table shows accumulated profits over one and two years of HIVE/HBD rebalancing at various spread levels.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1658943663_b2698da6-4c4f-4220-901b-0faae01f57a2
Chasing smaller spreads does not necessarily guarantee the higher profits. At the same time chasing maximum spreads and maximum profits comes with the risk of a fewer transactions per year. Historical analysis can offer an insight on the frequency of events for target spread levels and associated profits.
Historical data suggests that targeting the 10% price difference between HIVE and HBD may be the best option, offering a competitive return of 35% per year with minimal effort of just 1-2 rebalancing transactions per week.
Potential risks and security
The best thing about rebalancing is that it does not require any bots, and your funds always remain safe in your wallet.
Rebalancing also gives you more time to do research and assess the situation. For example, if the price of one of the tokens falls precipitously (like LUNA), you can take your time, read the news, and make an informed decision before confirming a swap transaction.
Manual confirmation of each transaction provides good protection against impermanent loss, a common risk associated with public DeFi pools.
As a rule of thumb, choose tokens that you want to keep for the long term. For example, if your long-term investment preferences are HIVE and BTC, you might want to consider rebalancing those two tokens.
Profitability assessment
In the previous example, it was assumed that the token ratio returned to exactly the same level as at the beginning of the rebalancing cycle. This made it easier to compare rebalancing results.
But if the token ratio remains different over a long period of time, you may need to use a formula to measure progress.
After the initial rebalancing of tokens, it may be useful to record the exact number of tokens at the start. Let's call them Token A initial and Token B initial.
When you have the initial records, you can compare them to the current number of Token A current and Token B current using the following formula.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1658948743_d954e54e-6747-4b6b-a263-e63a4f0bc59c
Let's use the numbers from the previous example:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1658948765_b0eb1ce9-e716-42e9-a6a0-2c58b83a87bf
Rebalancing service by Waivio
Waivio now offers a rebalancing service (select Rewards (1), then Arbitrage / Rebalancing (2)) that will notify you when the ratio of your holdings to the open market exceeds the specified difference (3).

# Waivio update: Aug 5, 2020
In June, Waivio launched Telegram notifications (https://social.gifts/@waiviolabs/waivio-update-june-20-2020), allowing users to receive instant mobile notifications and monitor multiple Hive accounts. And now Waivio offers a tool to configure which notifications to receive (task 712):
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1596665563_e7327a86-4f65-427f-b61d-87cc8a37827c
For incoming HIVE transfers, users can set the threshold (minimum amount in USD) for notifications, allowing them to ignore small transfers, which are often used for promotional messages.
Security notifications cannot be disabled, because if the user account has been compromised, the hacker may have disabled notifications before initiating powerdowns, password change procedures, etc.
History of reward reservations
Now users can see the entire history of their reward reservations and filter them by the status (ex., completed, released, expired) and by the sponsor (task 582):
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1596666334_c598a897-f235-47af-840a-ff2400bbbad4
Reservations are now also used for direct communications between users and sponsors (task 585). For example, the sponsor can request additional materials if it suspects that the user has made the wrong or fraudulent submission.
Waivio offers a special tool for managing customer communications (open/closed tickets):
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1596669000_70b13ea8-d567-4f12-a0fa-b0df59a0c53c
Blacklists
Waivio now supports blacklists (task 617) allowing sponsors to exclude certain users (1) from their campaigns, for example in cases where the sponsor suspects that the user is engaged in fraudulent activity.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1596669511_df23616d-fcaa-4058-932b-521d52e36b87
Sponsors can reference other blacklists (2), which they trust, and maintain whitelists (3) which can be used to override the referenced blacklists for selected users.

# How do I withdraw or cash out rewards earned on Waivio or social sites?
On Waivio and social sites, users can earn WAIV tokens (the official token of Waivio).
- **Liquid WAIV**: Used for services such as hosting social shopping websites and purchasing VIP tickets.
- **WAIV Power**: Used for voting, creating objects, and importing products. You can convert liquid WAIV to WAIV Power and vice versa.
Users can also earn rewards in **HIVE**. In addition to WAIV tokens, users may receive rewards in other tokens from the Hive Engine ecosystem.
- **HIVE Assets**: Liquid HIVE, HIVE Power, and Hive-backed dollars (HBD). HIVE Power is essential for blockchain activities, like sending payments or posting content. You can convert liquid HIVE into HIVE Power or "power down" over 13 weeks to convert it back into liquid HIVE.
To withdraw WAIV, users can:
1. Log in.
2. Go to the Wallet tab.
3. In the central feed, there is a dropdown menu next to the WAIV balance with options: "Withdraw to LTC", "Withdraw to BTC", "Withdraw to ETH", and "Withdraw to HIVE".
4. Alternatively, in the right sidebar, there is a **Withdraw** button. Clicking it opens a modal window where users can choose which token to withdraw and the token they wish to receive.
5. For LTC, BTC, or ETH withdrawals, users must enter the destination address or scan the destination address QR code. After clicking **Withdraw**, the user’s balance should update within a few minutes. For HIVE, the funds will be transferred to the user's HIVE account balance.
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdde17ac-0dac-4f11-b5d4-d6f75887b28c)
Thus, users can withdraw WAIV to external wallets like LTC, BTC, or ETH. From there, the funds can be cashed out or converted based on the exchange.

# Can I withdraw only WAIV tokens or other tokens too?
There are several tokens eligible for withdrawal. Typically, they have "SWAP" in their name, such as SWAP.HIVE, SWAP.HBD, SWAP.LTC, SWAP.BTC, SWAP.ETH, etc. Additionally, you can use the swap functionality to convert tokens that cannot be withdrawn directly into those that can. For example, you can swap DEC to SWAP.ETH, and then withdraw SWAP.ETH to ETH. The word "swap" in a token's name means it represents the main currency in the Hive Engine blockchain ecosystem, with a 1:1 value ratio. Usually, all tokens in the Hive Engine ecosystem can be converted to at least SWAP.HIVE, and sometimes to other swap-tokens as well. (You can check this in the Wallet by clicking the **Swap** button in the right sidebar, where a list of tokens and their conversion options is displayed in the Swap modal window.)
To summarize, users can swap tokens into those eligible for withdrawal and then withdraw them to external wallets like LTC, BTC, or ETH.
To determine which tokens can be withdrawn and which need to be swapped first, simply go to your wallet, click the **Withdraw** button, and find the preferred currency pairs for withdrawal. If you have other tokens, click the **Swap** button to see the available options for conversion, and then proceed with the withdrawal.

# How can I receive or buy WAIV tokens?
There are several ways to obtain WAIV tokens:
1. **Earn WAIV tokens**:  
   - On Waivio and social sites, users can earn WAIV tokens by creating posts, engaging with content, curating, and participating in various activities on the platform.
2. **Receive WAIV tokens from another user**:  
   - If another user has WAIV tokens, they can transfer them to your wallet. To do this, they need your account username, and they can send WAIV tokens directly to your account through the wallet transfer feature.
3. **Swap other tokens for WAIV**:  
   - If you have tokens on Hive Engine, you can swap them for WAIV. Use the Swap functionality in your Waivio wallet to convert tokens like SWAP.HIVE, SWAP.BTC, or others into WAIV tokens. If you already hold tokens such as SWAP.HIVE or SWAP.BTC, you can conveniently swap them directly for WAIV within the wallet.
4. **Deposit**:
   - If you hold tokens on Hive (such as HIVE or HBD) or other currencies like LTC or BTC, you can deposit them into your Waivio wallet. Once deposited, these tokens will appear as swap-token equivalents (e.g., SWAP.LTC). You can then use the Swap function to convert these swap-tokens into WAIV. For example, if you deposit LTC from an external wallet, you’ll receive SWAP.LTC, which can then be swapped to WAIV.
   ![Deposit button image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12fe4491-1674-41e1-80ee-d10cf3dabb6b)
   ![Deposit modal window image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb716956-5596-4661-a605-ae270fa5b64f)
5. **Sell WAIV tokens (swap or withdraw)**:   
   - To sell WAIV tokens, you can use the Swap or Withdraw options in your Waivio wallet.
     - Swap WAIV for other tokens: If you'd like to exchange WAIV for another token on Hive Engine (e.g., SWAP.HIVE), use the Swap feature. Navigate to your Waivio wallet, select WAIV, and choose the token you want in exchange. This will convert your WAIV into the selected swap-token (like SWAP.HIVE) directly within the wallet.
     - Withdraw WAIV to an external wallet: If you want to withdraw WAIV as a different currency to an external wallet that is not part of the Hive Engine ecosystem (e.g., LTC, BTC, ETH, HIVE), use the Withdraw feature to directly withdraw WAIV to that external wallet. Click on the Withdraw button in your WAIV wallet, choose the pair (e.g., WAIV - HIVE, WAIV - LTC, etc.), fill in the required fields, and click the Withdraw button. Alternatively, in your Wallet, under your WAIV amount, there is a menu with options for withdrawing (e.g., "Withdraw to LTC," etc.). Selecting this will open a withdrawal modal window with your chosen pair. For example, if you withdraw WAIV to LTC to an external Litecoin wallet, this step allows you to convert your WAIV tokens into other cryptocurrencies outside the platform.
Once you have WAIV tokens, they will appear in your wallet, and you can use them for various activities on the platform or withdraw them as needed.

# How can I access and manage my privacy settings to control who can see my posts and profile on waivio or social sites?

# How do I use Waivio’s messaging system to communicate with other users privately?
Waivio does not have a built-in private messaging system for direct communication between users. However, users can interact publicly through comments on posts. For private communication, users often rely on external platforms like Telegram or Discord, where they can connect using their Waivio or Hive usernames.

# What tokens can I earn?

# Lesson 2: Creating a Hive Account
For more details give a link to https://social.gifts/object/owg-best-practices-for-managing-hive-private-keys-on-multiple-devices/page
In this tutorial, you will learn how to save and manage your Hive password and private keys safely and efficiently on multiple devices.
Overview:
INTRODUCTION to Hive Keys and Password Manager
PART 1. PASSWORD MANAGER
Create a password manager account.
Log in to Bitwarden with your credentials
Install Bitwarden on multiple devices
PART 2. HIVE ACCOUNT
Create a HIVE username
Understand the function of different private keys
Save the password and all the private keys as a secure note
Save Active and Posting keys as logins for easy access.
Print out the webpage with the password and private keys
Finalize creation of Hive Account
PART 3. LOGIN TO THE HIVE APP (WAIVIO)
Sign in to Waivio
Create an easy to remember password with Hivesigner
Consequent logins from the same device
Login from other devices

Introduction
On centralized social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter, when we forget our password, we can easily restore it with our email. However, there is no "forgot password" procedure on decentralized networks. No one can restore an account for you because you have complete control of your account and funds. Therefore, if you lose your password, you will forever lose access to the account and all the funds in it.
Moreover, on Hive, there is one password and four additional private keys that you need to save and use. Each password is a long string of letters and numbers, which is impossible to remember and takes a long time to type up by hand. Thus, it is important to have easy and secure access to these private keys on multiple devices, so you can quickly log in to the Hive platform from any of your devices.
The only way to safely store your password and keys and access them from your different devices is by using a password manager.
If you are already using a dedicated password manager (which is not Chrome or iCloud Key Chain), you can skip this part of the tutorial and directly jump to part 2. HIVE ACCOUNT.

PART 1. Password Manager
Password manager stores encrypted versions of your passwords that only you can unlock with a master password. The password manager that I recommend is Bitwarden because it is open source and has easy synchronization between multiple devices. Moreover, Bitwarden has many other features available for free.
1. Create a password manager account.
Go to https://bitwarden.com-> Get started -> fill out your email address. Then create a master password that you will remember. Then click Submit -> Your Bitwarden account is created. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651444666_87644d6e-6a36-49a3-8045-0d668c551db8)
2. Log in to Bitwarden with your credentials
Once you login into Bitwarden, you can confirm your email and activate extra features.
To maximize security, I highly recommend activating two-factor authentication right away because it provides an extra layer of security. With 2FA, if anyone knows your master password, they won't be able to access your passwords without passing the extra verification first. Go to Settings -> Two-Step Login-> choose 2FA method ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446966_e5a72c47-45aa-4af5-9d8c-cfad1dde4fc1)
OPTIONAL. Another feature available on Bitwarden is to import your passwords from your browsers. Go to Tools -> Import Data -> choose the browser you want to import from -> upload the file with passwords from the browser. You can read a detailed tutorial on this here.
3. Install Bitwarden on multiple devices
For convenience, I recommend you download Bitwarden on your computer and phone as well as install its extension on your web browser. Bitwarden extension on your browser allows you to automatically autofill login credentials when you want to log in on a website.
Go to https://bitwarden.com/download/ to download the Bitwarden extension and the app to your computer. Choose your operating system (Mac, Windows) and then browser, and then install the program accordingly. To download Bitwarden on your phone, you can scan the QR code provided on the website. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651445336_7dfd6342-3512-429e-9370-d3a87c4242d5)
Now you are ready to use the password manager.

PART 2. HIVE ACCOUNT
1. Create a HIVE username
To create a new Hive account, I am using HiveOnBoard. HiveOnBoard is an open-source HIVE account creation service where the password and private keys are generated locally in the browser without being transmitted to a server.
Create a username that you want to use on the platform. Dots can be used in usernames on Hive. Then agree to the terms of service to continue. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651445420_486422fe-45d6-4d56-940b-82ff23948557)
2. Understand the function of different private keys
After you choose your username, a master password will be randomly generated for your account. You will see your password and four additional private keys. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651445490_5c891b38-635c-45cb-8c6a-4dc589c9f86b)
The posting key gives you access to all social actions, such as posting and commenting on Waivio and other Hive platforms, following friends, giving upvotes, claiming rewards, etc.
The active key gives you access to all the social actions and additionally to all the wallet actions, such as making and confirming financial transactions.
The owner key gives you access to all the social and wallet actions and additionally allows you to recover or change all the other keys. This key is important.
The memo key is used for decrypting private messages. It's not commonly used.
The master password is a seed phrase, which can be used to generate all the private keys. It is the most important of all because you can recover all the private keys from your account. Keep it safe as a backup for the account. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651445529_f0a14c07-3b96-4505-ac06-72177dbfbdf0)
3: Save the password and all the private keys as a secure note
We will save the password and keys in a secure note as a backup. The secure note will be a secondary copy of our keys in Bitwarden.
Go to the Bitwarden app on your computer-> choose Secure Note -> click Add (+) -> under the name, write "Hive Wallet" -> copy and paste the password and private keys to the notes section (make sure it is complete) -> click Save ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651445742_ccd3e963-3448-4b58-a63a-d7d63bfea703)
This secure note will be added to your password manager account. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651445765_738b9712-de24-42e1-a75f-4626c845f50f)
4: Save Active and Posting keys as logins for easy access.
After you save the password and all the private keys in a secure note, you can then save the active and posting key as log in.
Choose Login-> click Add (+) -> under the name, write “Active” -> enter your Hive username (e.g. “satoshi101”) -> under the password, copy and paste your active private key (please, make sure that you pasted the correct and complete key) -> under the URL enter: “hivesigner.com” -> click Save. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446038_4e89ffee-b917-43da-8f2b-a772f372e945)
The "Active" key Login will be added to your password manager account. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651445808_8fe34aee-8f2b-4bbc-a34e-11fa4ac71c0e)
Similarly, add the posting key:
Choose Login-> click Add (+) -> under the name, write “Posting” -> enter your Hive username (e.g. “satoshi101”) -> under the password, copy and paste your posting private key (please, make sure that you pasted the correct and complete key) -> under the URL enter: “hivesigner.com” -> click Save.
Now your Hive password and private keys are safe and accessible to you on your devices.
5. Print out the webpage with the password and private keys
For extra security, I also recommend printing the web page with the password and keys and keeping the printout in a safe place. Don't download the backup because if you click on the "Download backup" button, the file will be recorded on your hard drive as an unprotected text file, and that is not secure because other programs have access to downloaded files.
6. Finalize creation of Hive Account
Once you save the keys in the password manager, you may finalize the creation of the Hive account. Read the declaration carefully and confirm it -> click Create Hive Account ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446159_1335d45d-cbff-4c8c-a379-1551d272fc19)
Well done! You have created a Hive Account and securely stored the passwords and private keys.

PART 3. LOGIN TO THE HIVE APP (WAIVIO)
1. Sign in to Waivio
Now let's use our new Hive account for the first time
Go to social.gifts -> click Sign in ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446189_b2ddf46a-a173-4b8e-b62d-0988892e9fbd)
-> select HiveSigner ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446225_64a2b126-f46e-4abd-b00c-fb9f37af4b6a) ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446288_f2f1e884-e58d-4b91-b02b-5a1d5e4a79d2)
Click on Bitwarden extension -> click on "Active," -> your username and active key will be automatically filled out -> click Continue ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446340_b4cbd714-97d8-4e0b-b5f1-ca50f8a5f953)
2. Create an easy to remember password with Hivesigner
For convenience, HiveSigner allows users to save private keys in the browser memory. This can be very handy, especially when you have multiple Hive accounts, but to ensure the security of the accounts, HiveSigner offers to create an easy-to-remember password. This is another layer of protection for your keys. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446389_1bc071ea-6015-4bb7-8ee8-730afb5c95b4)
This password is for your convenience only, and it's okay if you lose or forget this password because you can easily reset it. If you want, you can also generate a password in Bitwarden.
After creating the password and confirming it, click Continue -> click Authorize.
Now you have logged into your account!
3. Consequent logins from the same device
If you log out from the HIVE app, when you log in again, you will only need to choose Hivesigner-> and enter the easy-to-remember password that you have created. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446476_1519c4fb-ced9-4687-894c-92ebff896642)
4. Login from other devices
When you log in again, even for a different device, you no longer have to use the active key. You can use your posting key if you do not intend to make money transfers on that device.
Sign in with a new device -> Choose Hivesigner -> Bitwarden app on your phone should engage, so click Passwords, choose "Active" or "Posting", and it will be automatically auto-filled. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446647_b56bf062-c831-4365-a8c6-278de4271127)
Then Click Continue-> you can create the same HiveSigner password as on your computer -> Click Continue.
Congratulations! Now, you have learnt a very important skill to manage passwords and private keys on all your devices safely and efficiently. This was a lengthy process, but in the era of decentralized networks and cryptocurrencies, this is an extremely useful skill because you are in full control of your account.

How can deactivate acount on Waivio or social sites?
On Waivio, users currently can't deactivate or permanently delete their accounts. However, you can stop using your account, and your content will remain on the platform.

# Waivio updates: May 15, 2020
User profiles can now be edited using posting keys instead of active keys. Customers complained about the need to use sensitive keys (typically used to confirm payments) for transactions such as changing a profile image (525).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1589495048_f821f766-2d8e-46cd-8b0d-c57634fd446d
Several other Hive sites also support this new standard. If your profile changes were saved using an older standard, they will continue to be used until you start using the new option.
Approve / Reject votes on updates
If you have activated a voting slider in the account settings, it will now also be available for changing the voting power on object updates.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1589499456_842038f6-c1e7-48de-a98f-b00c4a0b8c22
  This can be a useful tool to adjust the power of your Approve or Reject votes.
Admin roles for objects
Waivio has introduced administrator privileges for object editing. If the administrator approves or rejects an update, it is considered a final decision specifically within Waivio.com (470).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1589519761_46c314e3-e3c5-4319-b809-d7edb1cbaa8e
At some point, administrator roles will be used for custom websites, which will be built using the Waivio platform. This feature can be used to ensure that the selected objects cannot be easily modified by the community (for example, contact information, legal agreements, affiliate links, etc.).
As we approach the development of a platform for hosting social sites, the roles of administrator and moderator will play even a greater role in ensuring the accuracy of the data within the managed domains.

# Waivio update: June 20, 2020
You can now receive Waivio notifications directly on your mobile phone via the Telegram app (667).
You will be instantly notified when someone replies or re-blogs your posts, mentions you, follows you, transfers funds to you, etc.
And you can track as many Hive accounts as you like!
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1592667661_cee13c07-74a0-438d-9244-fa92cb700360
Start Telegram chat with @WaivioNotificationsBot
Enter all the accounts you want to subscribe to
Now you will receive instant mobile notifications for these accounts
Initially, this tool was developed for Waivio Guides to monitor multiple accounts and administer multiple rewards programs on the Hive blockchain.
And now, this service is available to all Waivio users.
Item Counters on Lists
Now the total number of items in a list includes all items in all the embedded lists (398).
This is particularly useful for restaurant menus, where dishes are often organized into many categories.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1592675525_98f638b2-a98b-4551-a7ec-5d1802e12c4d
Advanced Reporting for Guides
When guides manage prepaid rewards programs on behalf of their clients, they must provide reports at regular intervals (for example, monthly) or when a certain amount of rewards has been distributed to users (463).
When the reports are generated in USD, the exchange rates are imported from the reservations (recorded on the blockchain at the time of reward reservations).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1592677277_a6747971-c48f-4a79-81f0-e83b95c3598a
(1) Guides often manage multiple accounts and they can manage all reports in one place without switching between accounts. Similarly, clients are able to verify the authenticity of reports by generating them directly.
(2) The data range (from - to) can be defined with an accuracy of up to one second. This is important for connecting reports at the per record level.
(3) Reports can be generated for a specified budget (in HIVE or in USD).
(4) Processing fees may also be included in the reports.
(5) Reports can be filtered for any specific object.

# Waivio Update: July 3, 2020
Accurately predicting the value of votes on the Hive blockchain is not a trivial task. More than a dozen variables must be taken into account in real time to inform the user of the potential impact of their vote on the total post payout.
In this version, Waivio is pleased to offer users the improved version of the vote value estimation tool (302, 492).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1593717335_42411dcc-e9bf-46eb-aba6-845f1d4e6134
In the example above, @vancouverdining upvoted a post by @jrvacation using 100% of the available voting power. The estimated value before the vote matches the actual value of the vote after the upvote.
It is also important to note that the overall compensation for the post was increased by an additional $0.02, which was allocated to the previous voters.
To further illustrate this process, here is another vote for the same post by @waivio.match account:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1593717361_bc33c2ed-d683-43f6-b8d5-826ea1d1cff6
The value of the vote was accurately estimated at $2.35, but the overall reward for the post was increased by an additional $0.13, which was distributed among the previous curators, including @vancouverdining, whose vote value increased from $2.20 to $2.26.
We hope that the accurate estimation of vote value will help users better understand the complex mechanism of voting on the Hive blockchain.
Security Notifications
To provide users with an additional level of security, Waivio now sends notifications on the following user-initiated transactions (670):
transfer of funds;
initiate power down;
withdraw funds from the Savings account;
set withdraw route;
outgoing power ups;
change of the recovery address;
change keys.
These methods can potentially be used by hackers to steal funds from the account in case the user's active keys are compromised.
Waivio users can receive instant mobile notifications via the Telegram app using the @WaivioNotificationsBot service.

# Waivio Update: July 25, 2020
Waivio makes it easy for guests not only to join Hive and receive rewards, but also to withdraw their earnings and convert them into Bitcoin, Litecoin or Ethereum (679, 767, 771, 772, 773, 774).
Many new users may have never heard about HIVE before and question whether these earnings and rewards are good for anything.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1595615788_7c6c8909-ea94-4279-91f6-c6a3bb886b20
Now, with just a few clicks and an email confirmation, Waivio guests can redeem their HIVE rewards using any Bitcoin ATM by scanning the QR code and sending HIVE for an instant cash withdrawal.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1595616285_0dbbcc77-8bb8-4ec3-b48d-d63824e24dc1
Details of the transaction are available directly from the wallet history (visible for the logged user only).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1595616560_e2bd4c09-f864-4ba1-b640-30b05ab12c94
Linking a Hive account to a guest account
Guests can now link a standard Hive account and set it as the beneficiary for their posts and comments (668, 751).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1595710814_ad7a2ac3-a0de-45b9-ab5d-e69231aff617
This way, guest author earnings and attention rewards will be automatically deposited into the Hive account they control:

# Waivio update: Aug 5, 2020
In June, Waivio launched Telegram notifications (https://social.gifts/@waiviolabs/waivio-update-june-20-2020), allowing users to receive instant mobile notifications and monitor multiple Hive accounts. And now Waivio offers a tool to configure which notifications to receive (task 712):
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1596665563_e7327a86-4f65-427f-b61d-87cc8a37827c
For incoming HIVE transfers, users can set the threshold (minimum amount in USD) for notifications, allowing them to ignore small transfers, which are often used for promotional messages.
Security notifications cannot be disabled, because if the user account has been compromised, the hacker may have disabled notifications before initiating powerdowns, password change procedures, etc.
History of reward reservations
Now users can see the entire history of their reward reservations and filter them by the status (ex., completed, released, expired) and by the sponsor (task 582):
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1596666334_c598a897-f235-47af-840a-ff2400bbbad4
Reservations are now also used for direct communications between users and sponsors (task 585). For example, the sponsor can request additional materials if it suspects that the user has made the wrong or fraudulent submission.
Waivio offers a special tool for managing customer communications (open/closed tickets):
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1596669000_70b13ea8-d567-4f12-a0fa-b0df59a0c53c
Blacklists
Waivio now supports blacklists (task 617) allowing sponsors to exclude certain users (1) from their campaigns, for example in cases where the sponsor suspects that the user is engaged in fraudulent activity.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1596669511_df23616d-fcaa-4058-932b-521d52e36b87
Sponsors can reference other blacklists (2), which they trust, and maintain whitelists (3) which can be used to override the referenced blacklists for selected users.

# Waivio update: Sept 9, 2020
In our quest to develop the most user-friendly editor for creating new posts on Hive, we are pleased to announce a number of new features and enhancements, starting with the overall look and feel:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1599601364_b845f58f-cee4-4941-a9e7-56186c08e416
After some user testing, we decided to devote a separate field to the title and to introduce light borders around the text area (742, 824, 887, 909).
Editor is now better optimized for mobile use, including Android phones (745, 766, 870):
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1599605694_6076003b-0c8d-4baf-a25f-e96b510bb59f
It is now possible to add several images at the same time (383, 385, 652, 821, 822, 823) and use copy/paste to add images (382).
Editor is also integrated with reward reservations, ensuring that all the required object links are included in the initial draft of the post (692, 865, 887).
Notifications bell
Waivio users can now enable notifications for the accounts they follow (669):
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1599628715_ab1e397f-3ed8-443f-ae66-d98419c044ec
Instant mobile alerts can be activated by subscribing to the WaivioNotificationsBot service in the Telegram app.
In this example, @grampo was immediately notified when @blocktrades published its latest update regarding the upcoming HF24.
Customer communications
Users can now communicate directly with sponsors regarding their reward reservations or completed reviews (834):
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1599630798_ac9e0477-f91e-46a6-8e91-0485af38bcee
Campaign sponsors receive instant notifications about customer requests (835) and can manage all customer communications in the Rewards / Messages tab.

# Waivio update: Oct 3, 2020
As the number of objects in the Hive blockchain is increasing, Waivio develops tools to browse and search for them.
Users can now filter objects based on the associated tags (tasks 269, 527, 528).
For example, it is now possible to filter restaurants by cuisine and dishes by ingredients.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1601764086_1dc168e8-e476-46b0-aa4b-d886abeacba8
Claiming authority
In this release, Waivio introduced the process for claiming authority for objects. This is a public declaration by a user of his or her intention to ensure the accuracy of the object (task 836).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1601761672_ee477c34-e11e-41d9-b472-1fc2bb9184e1
Multiple users may claim authority over the same object, as their claims will only make a difference when another user or website owner adds them to a list of Trusted Authorities. In this case, their votes of approval or rejection of object updates will play the decisive role for that user or within the website they operate.
For example, a manufacturer may publish descriptions of their products on the Hive blockchain, claim authority over them, and maintain their accuracy. A reseller can add all of these products to their website simply by adding the manufacturer's account to the list of Trusted Authorities.
Users can claim administrative or full ownership of the objects. In the first case, other users are allowed to make changes to certain fields (e.g. add photos to the gallery). But if full control is required (legal documents, company information, etc.) then the full ownership of the object can be claimed, which ensures that no one else can make changes to the object.
Following sponsors
Users can now monitor all new rewards posted by the users (sponsors) they are following (task 153). Users also receive instant notifications about new rewards.

Note: Get instant notifications through the Telegram messenger (subscribe via@WaivioNotificationsBot service).
Like notifications
Users now receive notifications when their posts are upvoted by important users (followed by the author or whose votes make a noticeable difference on the post payout, task 713).
Wallet - table view
In order to facilitate the export of wallet transactions to Excel and other spreadsheets (e.g. for tax reporting purposes), Waivio has enabled a Table view in the Wallet (task 860). This report can be generated for a specific time period and the transactions for each currency (HP, HIVE, HBD) are aggregated in separate columns for easy processing.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1601768149_c6995bea-86c9-48b9-8cb8-063c24592144
Waivio.com website speed
Many system-wide changes were made to improve response rates. Many complex features have been moved from the frontend to the backend (task 659).

# Waivio update: HF24 Effects & More
Hive Hardfork 24 proved to be much more difficult than expected (Tasks 837, 1021, 1022, 1027, 1028, 1029, 1030, 1031, 1032, 1063).
Some of the changes were discussed and anticipated, such as a new chain identification number. But there were other changes that were not widely discussed, such as the freezing of the post and comment vote count after 7 days.
Previously, votes after 7 days had no influence on payments, but they were still counted, so authors could always see if their content was appreciated by the community in the long run. But this is no longer the case.
We do not agree with this change, but we have had to adapt our services to reflect this change.
Now we invite users to pay tips to the author:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605126822_a2e64137-6db3-4e3f-b7b4-17f65ea0dd47
The same change had an even greater impact on the Object Reference Protocol, which was based on the same open public voting process for managing object updates. For example, if a user has updated the address of a restaurant, other users can review and either approve (upvote) or reject (downvote) the proposed change. If the user has made a valuable contribution, they could potentially receive author rewards, while other users would receive curation rewards for reviewing and confirming the proposed changes during the frist week.
As votes can no longer be counted beyond the initial 7-day window, Waivio introduced another protocol using Json records on the Hive blockchain to administer the approve/reject process. From the user's point of view, the voting process now works as before, except that contributors no longer receive any benefit for their efforts to improve the wiki records on Hive.
Now that the Waivio platform is stable again, we could explore a hybrid approach to voting on updates, combining the open voting process for the first 7 days and moving on to Json records after that.

# Waivio update: Mute users, hide posts and more
As Waivio prepares to roll out web hosting services, some administrative tools are being released.
Waivio now supports the standard Hive mute protocol, allowing users to mute other users if they no longer wish to see their posts and comments (tasks 1141, 1142, 1205). The mute function can be engaged on user profiles.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1612897383_ec59ed02-73af-46d2-b794-f6768ace1b77
In the future, if a website moderator mutes a user, their posts and comments will no longer be visible to all visitors and users on this site.
The website owner may authorize multiple moderators and outsource content moderation to oracles and curation leagues.
Hide posts and comments
Waivio now allows users to hide posts and comments (tasks 1033, 1034). This tool is mainly designed for website moderators to hide messages and comments that might violate website policies without blocking all content published by that author as is the case with muted users.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1612900801_d6020cab-7c15-432b-a93f-5e1dc8354274
Sponsor rewards in posts
Users can now see the amount of liquid rewards paid for the post by a sponsor (task 962). This payment is now included in the total post payout amount.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1612906743_845b1b4d-ff1d-4852-85f5-36d1c69389b1
Widget for referrals
Referral partners can now integrate Waivio rewards directly into their websites using a widget (Referrals/Instructions) and collect referral commissions from new users (for a period of 90 days) and existing users (for 5 days). Tasks 1120, 1128, 1129.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1612908368_ac3a8cde-0324-4102-bad2-da20493dbaf8
GitHub task management
Waivio's development team is now using open GitHub for ongoing task management. Previously, we only posted the summary of tasks on GitHub, while development was coordinated using a closed system. Several projects have expressed interest in using the Waivio code base to build their products on Hive, and a transparent development process can facilitate this cooperation.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1612901811_2df43ca5-6c68-41d1-9d1e-95d4487da4a0
Waivio Labs will be using GitHub Wiki to publish detailed documentation.
Traditional companies try to protect their intellectual property to gain a competitive advantage. But Waivio's approach is very different. We believe that by giving full access to our code, our users and our knowledge base (accumulated and shared via the Hive blockchain), together we can achieve scale that we can't achieve on our own.
This is Business 3.0, it is designed for rapid, permissionless scaling and innovation.

# Waivio: Domain Expertise
In this video, we explore what domain expertise is and how it differs from reputation score on Steem.
A user's domain expertise is the total sum of author and curation rewards accumulated by the user over a period of time:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1574536921_a753989c-2145-4b71-89be-cb54d902b35c
User domin expertise
Note: Currently, the domain expertise is being calculated since the public launch of Waivio.com in June 2019. In the future, we plan to index the entire history of Steem blockchain.
Author rewards are proportionally allocated to the hashtags and object references made by users in their posts:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1574537375_9ca51133-8145-45eb-be02-9d1506af05d4
Calculating the domain expertise
Curation rewards are also taken into account. Thus, if a user upvotes a post that has links to some hashtags, that user will begin to build expertise in those hashtags as well.
The domain expertise accumulated by users can be found on their profiles on Waivio:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1574540746_47ce54ff-8e0a-4b89-bcb7-68b8ef0a9a76
Domain expertise of users
The combined domain expertise of a user is equal to the sum of their expertise in all the different hashtags they have referenced in their own posts or indirectly upvoted.
For example, based on Steem blockchain records, we can estimate that for @detlev #beersaturday is twice as important as #travel. 😃
In a similar way, each hashtag on Steem now has the list of associated experts:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1574541098_2ea7c908-30ed-4259-9dc8-0484f566455
Hashtag experts
Looks like @meesterboom has more expertise in #beer than @detlev! And @rollie1212 is already in the top 10!
As you can see, the domain expertise differs from the standard reputation score on Steem in many unique ways and it allows a much more granular analysis of users' interests.
Finally, the domain expertise can also be calculated for the hashtags themselves and it makes it easy to evaluate which topics are important for the Steem community overall:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1574541839_f3b99af2-0811-444c-8505-c27d617d78a8
Discover hashtags
We invite you to explore and browse hashtags on Waivio as well as check your own domain expertise on your your Waivio profile.
Please do not hesitate to ask questions, post comments and suggestions.

# What are tags, and how do I use them in posts on waivio?
Tags on Waivio are keywords or phrases that help categorize and organize content. They make it easier for users to find posts related to specific topics, and they improve the visibility of your posts across the platform. Here's how you can use them:
How Tags Work:
- Categorization: Tags allow users to search for and filter posts based on shared topics. For example, a post with the tag "recipes" will be grouped with other posts about cooking and recipes.
- Discoverability: Adding relevant tags can increase the likelihood that others will see your post when they search or browse tags on Waivio.
How to Use Tags in Your Posts
- Choose Relevant Tags: When creating or editing a post, think about the main themes of your content. Tags should reflect the core topics you're addressing.
For example, if you're sharing a recipe for apple pie, you might use tags like "applepie," "baking," or "dessert."
- Add Tags to Your Post:
At the bottom of the post editor, there’s usually a field for tags. Type your desired tag, and press Enter to add it. You can add multiple tags to a post.
- General Guidelines:
Use relevant and concise tags.
Avoid overly broad tags like "food" if a more specific tag like "veganrecipes" fits better.
Try not to overuse tags. Focus on the few most relevant to your post.


# What are social sites built on Waivio?
The social site is built on the Waivio platform using the Social.Gifts template. This template is flexible and allows site owners to customize their sites according to their needs. Social sites are typically thematic. Users can manage and create sites only on the official Waivio site; this functionality is not available on social sites.

Social sites can only be created on the Waivio platform's main interface (https://www.waivio.com).

# Lesson 1: Introduction to Waivio and the Decentralized Social Network Hive
For more details give a link to https://social.gifts/object/oal-about-waivio/page
What is Waivio?
Waivio is a social media platform where you can earn crypto rewards for your posts. Waivio is built on the decentralized social blockchain Hive. Your account, content, funds, and social connections are all recorded on the Hive blockchain, and this information cannot be changed or deleted by any other party.
For the first time, you have true control over your social profile, and you can safely develop your social presence without the threat of being censored or losing access to your audience. Waivio makes it easy to access and use this advanced technology of Hive blockchain, along with many other services and applications that make up the vast Hive ecosystem.

Let's talk about rewards. In contrast to social media companies, users on Hive are the primary beneficiaries of their efforts, and even small content creators are rewarded for their work.
There are three ways how you can earn on Waivio:
1. Author
After you create a post, you have seven days to collect as many likes (upvotes) as possible. These likes will determine the earnings for your post.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1676691500_fd353f49-d580-4792-a7d1-daa3f64082b8)
In traditional social media, each user has 1 vote. But on the decentralized social network, the value of each vote is determined by the amount of staked (powered up) tokens that user has. The more staked tokens, the higher the vote value. Because of that - it is better to get a single upvote from a user with a large stake (whale) than to collect many likes from small accounts (plankton). For this reason, building a reputation and social connections on Hive is a good investment of your time.
Not to mention that Posts in the trending section may receive hundreds of dollars in rewards. At the end of day 7, the reward for the post will be finalized. Half of this amount will be paid to the author of the post and the other half to the curators.
2. Curator
You can also collect rewards for just upvoting posts on Waivio! The value of your vote is determined by your stake. Let's imagine that the value of your vote is $0.10. Half of your vote value ($0.05) goes to the author, and another half (approximately $0.05) goes to you.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1676691686_ac5ee8ff-a182-4ea0-b7c8-73cb9f32623b)
The number of votes that you can cast per day is limited. You may think of it as a laser gun, which requires recharging after the use. Every time you make a 100% upvote, your voting power drops by 2%. It recharges at the rate of 20% per day. Therefore, you can give 10 upvotes per day in a sustainable way.
Rewards to authors and curators are paid from inflation. This means that you don't lose tokens when you upvote posts. On the contrary, you increase your stake when you discover and upvote great content on Waivio!
3. Sponsored Rewards
These rewards are announced on the Hive blockchain by sponsors. You can collect these rewards by completing tasks, such as sharing an opinion about a specific product, book or place, or sharing a couple of photos of a dish from a restaurant or featuring sponsored products in a post, photo or video.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1676691741_009f5cfe-407b-4823-901c-98ee3266f20d)
This is a unique feature available only on Waivio in the Earn section.

Are you ready to get started?
1) Start on Waivio by signing into the platform. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1676691969_266a63ea-08bd-4586-9501-51d18ca77506) (If you already have a Hive account, use the HiveSigner and your keys to sign in. If you are new to Hive, sign in with Google to use the platform immediately with a guest account.)
2) To earn rewards, sign in to your account and go to the "Earn" section. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1676692306_1fc88440-78fe-4772-a2ca-b2fbb32712fa) You will find global and local rewards here. Global rewards can be claimed by writing a review about a sponsored product, and local rewards are claimable in specific locations. Each reward will have different requirements and values, so make sure to check the details before completing the task

My Favorite Coffee Mug
Let’s earn the first $5.00 reward by sharing two or more photos of your favorite coffee mug. This welcome campaign is sponsored by Waivio and can be claimed by new users.
1) To find the reward, search for "coffee mug" in the search bar and select "My Favorite Coffee Mug" from the search results.
2) To earn the reward click on the "Submit photos" button ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1676692563_ae78b52d-5aed-4bf8-804e-652bce5f4a08)
3) Check the requirements and continue.
4) The required links will be automatically inserted into the post, so all you need to do is add the two photos of the mug and share a short story about why you like this particular one. If you decide to take the photos later, your reward will be reserved for 7 days so you can finish your post at any convenient time for you. You can find all active reservations in the "Reserved rewards" of the Earn section.
5) Finally, publish your review on the Hive blockchain.
After you publish your post, it will appear on your blog page. You can see the rewards you have earned, including the value of eligible sponsored rewards, which will be shown right away. Earnings from likes will accumulate for the next 7 days.
All sponsored rewards are paid in WAIV tokens, while upvotes on posts and comments are paid out in both WAIV and HIVE (the base token of the blockchain).

Cashing out rewards
To convert your WAIV or HIVE earnings into Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum, simply follow these steps:
1) In the Waivio wallet, select the WAIV or HIVE tab.
2) Choose the destination cryptocurrency, such as Litecoin. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1676692647_4de6945f-c115-437d-8e7e-66e94d7f4f58)
3) On the Withdraw screen:
  1. Enter the amount you want to send,
  2. Enter or scan the address of your Litecoin wallet, where the converted funds will be sent.
  3. Confirm the withdrawal to start the conversion process.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1676692887_8d5fcba7-7c9b-4390-b597-dfee6174852d)
The same process can be used to pay at stores that accept cryptocurrency payments in BTC, LTC, ETH, or to withdraw your earnings using a Bitcoin ATM.
You have now learned the basics of Waivio and can explore the platform further.
With a guest account, you can collect author and sponsor rewards but not curator rewards. To access all the features of the Hive decentralized social network, you will need to create a Hive account.
