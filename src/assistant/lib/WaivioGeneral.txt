# Lesson 1: Introduction to Waivio and the Decentralized Social Network Hive
For more details give a link to https://social.gifts/object/oal-about-waivio/page
What is Waivio?
Waivio is a social media platform where you can earn crypto rewards for your posts. Waivio is built on the decentralized social blockchain Hive. Your account, content, funds, and social connections are all recorded on the Hive blockchain, and this information cannot be changed or deleted by any other party.
For the first time, you have true control over your social profile, and you can safely develop your social presence without the threat of being censored or losing access to your audience. Waivio makes it easy to access and use this advanced technology of Hive blockchain, along with many other services and applications that make up the vast Hive ecosystem.

Let's talk about rewards. In contrast to social media companies, users on Hive are the primary beneficiaries of their efforts, and even small content creators are rewarded for their work.
There are three ways how you can earn on Waivio:
1. Author
After you create a post, you have seven days to collect as many likes (upvotes) as possible. These likes will determine the earnings for your post.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1676691500_fd353f49-d580-4792-a7d1-daa3f64082b8)
In traditional social media, each user has 1 vote. But on the decentralized social network, the value of each vote is determined by the amount of staked (powered up) tokens that user has. The more staked tokens, the higher the vote value. Because of that - it is better to get a single upvote from a user with a large stake (whale) than to collect many likes from small accounts (plankton). For this reason, building a reputation and social connections on Hive is a good investment of your time.
Not to mention that Posts in the trending section may receive hundreds of dollars in rewards. At the end of day 7, the reward for the post will be finalized. Half of this amount will be paid to the author of the post and the other half to the curators.
2. Curator
You can also collect rewards for just upvoting posts on Waivio! The value of your vote is determined by your stake. Let's imagine that the value of your vote is $0.10. Half of your vote value ($0.05) goes to the author, and another half (approximately $0.05) goes to you.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1676691686_ac5ee8ff-a182-4ea0-b7c8-73cb9f32623b)
The number of votes that you can cast per day is limited. You may think of it as a laser gun, which requires recharging after the use. Every time you make a 100% upvote, your voting power drops by 2%. It recharges at the rate of 20% per day. Therefore, you can give 10 upvotes per day in a sustainable way.
Rewards to authors and curators are paid from inflation. This means that you don't lose tokens when you upvote posts. On the contrary, you increase your stake when you discover and upvote great content on Waivio!
3. Sponsored Rewards
These rewards are announced on the Hive blockchain by sponsors. You can collect these rewards by completing tasks, such as sharing an opinion about a specific product, book or place, or sharing a couple of photos of a dish from a restaurant or featuring sponsored products in a post, photo or video.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1676691741_009f5cfe-407b-4823-901c-98ee3266f20d)
This is a unique feature available only on Waivio in the Earn section.

Are you ready to get started?
1) Start on Waivio by signing into the platform. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1676691969_266a63ea-08bd-4586-9501-51d18ca77506) (If you already have a Hive account, use the HiveSigner and your keys to sign in. If you are new to Hive, sign in with Google to use the platform immediately with a guest account.)
2) To earn rewards, sign in to your account and go to the "Earn" section. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1676692306_1fc88440-78fe-4772-a2ca-b2fbb32712fa) You will find global and local rewards here. Global rewards can be claimed by writing a review about a sponsored product, and local rewards are claimable in specific locations. Each reward will have different requirements and values, so make sure to check the details before completing the task

My Favorite Coffee Mug
Let’s earn the first $5.00 reward by sharing two or more photos of your favorite coffee mug. This welcome campaign is sponsored by Waivio and can be claimed by new users.
1) To find the reward, search for "coffee mug" in the search bar and select "My Favorite Coffee Mug" from the search results.
2) To earn the reward click on the "Submit photos" button ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1676692563_ae78b52d-5aed-4bf8-804e-652bce5f4a08)
3) Check the requirements and continue.
4) The required links will be automatically inserted into the post, so all you need to do is add the two photos of the mug and share a short story about why you like this particular one. If you decide to take the photos later, your reward will be reserved for 7 days so you can finish your post at any convenient time for you. You can find all active reservations in the "Reserved rewards" of the Earn section.
5) Finally, publish your review on the Hive blockchain.
After you publish your post, it will appear on your blog page. You can see the rewards you have earned, including the value of eligible sponsored rewards, which will be shown right away. Earnings from likes will accumulate for the next 7 days.
All sponsored rewards are paid in WAIV tokens, while upvotes on posts and comments are paid out in both WAIV and HIVE (the base token of the blockchain).

Cashing out rewards
To convert your WAIV or HIVE earnings into Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum, simply follow these steps:
1) In the Waivio wallet, select the WAIV or HIVE tab.
2) Choose the destination cryptocurrency, such as Litecoin. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1676692647_4de6945f-c115-437d-8e7e-66e94d7f4f58)
3) On the Withdraw screen:

# Lesson 2: Creating a Hive Account
For more details give a link to https://social.gifts/object/owg-best-practices-for-managing-hive-private-keys-on-multiple-devices/page
In this tutorial, you will learn how to save and manage your Hive password and private keys safely and efficiently on multiple devices.
Overview:
INTRODUCTION to Hive Keys and Password Manager
PART 1. PASSWORD MANAGER
Create a password manager account.
Log in to Bitwarden with your credentials
Install Bitwarden on multiple devices
PART 2. HIVE ACCOUNT
Create a HIVE username
Understand the function of different private keys
Save the password and all the private keys as a secure note
Save Active and Posting keys as logins for easy access.
Print out the webpage with the password and private keys
Finalize creation of Hive Account
PART 3. LOGIN TO THE HIVE APP (WAIVIO)
Sign in to Waivio
Create an easy to remember password with Hivesigner
Consequent logins from the same device
Login from other devices

Introduction
On centralized social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter, when we forget our password, we can easily restore it with our email. However, there is no "forgot password" procedure on decentralized networks. No one can restore an account for you because you have complete control of your account and funds. Therefore, if you lose your password, you will forever lose access to the account and all the funds in it.
Moreover, on Hive, there is one password and four additional private keys that you need to save and use. Each password is a long string of letters and numbers, which is impossible to remember and takes a long time to type up by hand. Thus, it is important to have easy and secure access to these private keys on multiple devices, so you can quickly log in to the Hive platform from any of your devices.
The only way to safely store your password and keys and access them from your different devices is by using a password manager.
If you are already using a dedicated password manager (which is not Chrome or iCloud Key Chain), you can skip this part of the tutorial and directly jump to part 2. HIVE ACCOUNT.

PART 1. Password Manager
Password manager stores encrypted versions of your passwords that only you can unlock with a master password. The password manager that I recommend is Bitwarden because it is open source and has easy synchronization between multiple devices. Moreover, Bitwarden has many other features available for free.
1. Create a password manager account.
Go to https://bitwarden.com-> Get started -> fill out your email address. Then create a master password that you will remember. Then click Submit -> Your Bitwarden account is created. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651444666_87644d6e-6a36-49a3-8045-0d668c551db8)
2. Log in to Bitwarden with your credentials
Once you login into Bitwarden, you can confirm your email and activate extra features.
To maximize security, I highly recommend activating two-factor authentication right away because it provides an extra layer of security. With 2FA, if anyone knows your master password, they won't be able to access your passwords without passing the extra verification first. Go to Settings -> Two-Step Login-> choose 2FA method ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446966_e5a72c47-45aa-4af5-9d8c-cfad1dde4fc1)
OPTIONAL. Another feature available on Bitwarden is to import your passwords from your browsers. Go to Tools -> Import Data -> choose the browser you want to import from -> upload the file with passwords from the browser. You can read a detailed tutorial on this here.
3. Install Bitwarden on multiple devices
For convenience, I recommend you download Bitwarden on your computer and phone as well as install its extension on your web browser. Bitwarden extension on your browser allows you to automatically autofill login credentials when you want to log in on a website.
Go to https://bitwarden.com/download/ to download the Bitwarden extension and the app to your computer. Choose your operating system (Mac, Windows) and then browser, and then install the program accordingly. To download Bitwarden on your phone, you can scan the QR code provided on the website. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651445336_7dfd6342-3512-429e-9370-d3a87c4242d5)
Now you are ready to use the password manager.

PART 2. HIVE ACCOUNT
1. Create a HIVE username
To create a new Hive account, I am using HiveOnBoard. HiveOnBoard is an open-source HIVE account creation service where the password and private keys are generated locally in the browser without being transmitted to a server.
Create a username that you want to use on the platform. Dots can be used in usernames on Hive. Then agree to the terms of service to continue. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651445420_486422fe-45d6-4d56-940b-82ff23948557)
2. Understand the function of different private keys
After you choose your username, a master password will be randomly generated for your account. You will see your password and four additional private keys. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651445490_5c891b38-635c-45cb-8c6a-4dc589c9f86b)
The posting key gives you access to all social actions, such as posting and commenting on Waivio and other Hive platforms, following friends, giving upvotes, claiming rewards, etc.
The active key gives you access to all the social actions and additionally to all the wallet actions, such as making and confirming financial transactions.
The owner key gives you access to all the social and wallet actions and additionally allows you to recover or change all the other keys. This key is important.
The memo key is used for decrypting private messages. It's not commonly used.
The master password is a seed phrase, which can be used to generate all the private keys. It is the most important of all because you can recover all the private keys from your account. Keep it safe as a backup for the account. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651445529_f0a14c07-3b96-4505-ac06-72177dbfbdf0)
3: Save the password and all the private keys as a secure note
We will save the password and keys in a secure note as a backup. The secure note will be a secondary copy of our keys in Bitwarden.
Go to the Bitwarden app on your computer-> choose Secure Note -> click Add (+) -> under the name, write "Hive Wallet" -> copy and paste the password and private keys to the notes section (make sure it is complete) -> click Save ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651445742_ccd3e963-3448-4b58-a63a-d7d63bfea703)
This secure note will be added to your password manager account. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651445765_738b9712-de24-42e1-a75f-4626c845f50f)
4: Save Active and Posting keys as logins for easy access.
After you save the password and all the private keys in a secure note, you can then save the active and posting key as log in.
Choose Login-> click Add (+) -> under the name, write “Active” -> enter your Hive username (e.g. “satoshi101”) -> under the password, copy and paste your active private key (please, make sure that you pasted the correct and complete key) -> under the URL enter: “hivesigner.com” -> click Save. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446038_4e89ffee-b917-43da-8f2b-a772f372e945)
The "Active" key Login will be added to your password manager account. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651445808_8fe34aee-8f2b-4bbc-a34e-11fa4ac71c0e)
Similarly, add the posting key:
Choose Login-> click Add (+) -> under the name, write “Posting” -> enter your Hive username (e.g. “satoshi101”) -> under the password, copy and paste your posting private key (please, make sure that you pasted the correct and complete key) -> under the URL enter: “hivesigner.com” -> click Save.
Now your Hive password and private keys are safe and accessible to you on your devices.
5. Print out the webpage with the password and private keys
For extra security, I also recommend printing the web page with the password and keys and keeping the printout in a safe place. Don't download the backup because if you click on the "Download backup" button, the file will be recorded on your hard drive as an unprotected text file, and that is not secure because other programs have access to downloaded files.
6. Finalize creation of Hive Account
Once you save the keys in the password manager, you may finalize the creation of the Hive account. Read the declaration carefully and confirm it -> click Create Hive Account ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446159_1335d45d-cbff-4c8c-a379-1551d272fc19)
Well done! You have created a Hive Account and securely stored the passwords and private keys.

PART 3. LOGIN TO THE HIVE APP (WAIVIO)
1. Sign in to Waivio
Now let's use our new Hive account for the first time
Go to social.gifts -> click Sign in ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446189_b2ddf46a-a173-4b8e-b62d-0988892e9fbd)
-> select HiveSigner ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446225_64a2b126-f46e-4abd-b00c-fb9f37af4b6a) ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446288_f2f1e884-e58d-4b91-b02b-5a1d5e4a79d2)
Click on Bitwarden extension -> click on "Active," -> your username and active key will be automatically filled out -> click Continue ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446340_b4cbd714-97d8-4e0b-b5f1-ca50f8a5f953)
2. Create an easy to remember password with Hivesigner
For convenience, HiveSigner allows users to save private keys in the browser memory. This can be very handy, especially when you have multiple Hive accounts, but to ensure the security of the accounts, HiveSigner offers to create an easy-to-remember password. This is another layer of protection for your keys. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446389_1bc071ea-6015-4bb7-8ee8-730afb5c95b4)
This password is for your convenience only, and it's okay if you lose or forget this password because you can easily reset it. If you want, you can also generate a password in Bitwarden.
After creating the password and confirming it, click Continue -> click Authorize.
Now you have logged into your account!
3. Consequent logins from the same device
If you log out from the HIVE app, when you log in again, you will only need to choose Hivesigner-> and enter the easy-to-remember password that you have created. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446476_1519c4fb-ced9-4687-894c-92ebff896642)
4. Login from other devices
When you log in again, even for a different device, you no longer have to use the active key. You can use your posting key if you do not intend to make money transfers on that device.
Sign in with a new device -> Choose Hivesigner -> Bitwarden app on your phone should engage, so click Passwords, choose "Active" or "Posting", and it will be automatically auto-filled. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446647_b56bf062-c831-4365-a8c6-278de4271127)
Then Click Continue-> you can create the same HiveSigner password as on your computer -> Click Continue.
Congratulations! Now, you have learnt a very important skill to manage passwords and private keys on all your devices safely and efficiently. This was a lengthy process, but in the era of decentralized networks and cryptocurrencies, this is an extremely useful skill because you are in full control of your account.


How do I enable two-factor authentication?
Hive, like other blockchain platforms, operates on a decentralized security model. The security primarily relies on private keys for account access and transactions. If a user's private keys are secure, their account is secure. The inherent security model of blockchain reduces the emphasis on traditional 2FA mechanisms.
In the blockchain space, users are expected to take personal responsibility for their security. This includes securely storing private keys, using hardware wallets, and following best practices for online security. The emphasis is on user education and responsibility rather than providing additional layers like 2FA.

Are there any fees for using the site?
Using the site itself is generally free, including basic actions like posting, commenting, and voting. However, there are some functionalities that may require payment. For example, users might need to pay for running a site or purchasing a VIP ticket for enhanced features. Additionally, blockchain network transaction fees may apply when performing operations such as transfers.
If a user wants their vote to have significant impact and to potentially receive rewards, their voting power should be backed by an amount of WAIV or HIVE tokens, or preferably both. Users should review the terms and conditions of the specific services they use for any applicable fees.

How can I report inappropriate content or users?
Ways to eliminate inappropriate content or users:
- Downvote a post: Users can downvote a specific post by clicking on the three-dot menu on the post and selecting "Flag post." This can reduce the rewards that the post might receive.
- Hide a post: Users can hide a post so that only they will not see it. If the user has site permissions (moderator, administrator, owner), the post will not be shown on the site.
- Mute a user: Users can mute another user by opening the user's profile, clicking on the three-dot menu near the "Follow" button, and selecting "Mute." This allows you to block the user, preventing you from seeing their posts and imposing other restrictions.

What tokens can I earn?
User can earn WAIV, HIVE, and various other Hive Engine tokens. Some of these tokens can be swapped to SWAP.LTC, SWAP.BTC, SWAP.ETH. Once swapped, they can be withdrawn to wallets: BTC, LTC, and ETH.

What information do I need to provide to sign up?
To sign up, visit signup.hive.io. There are a few options for creating an account:
- Purchase an account: You can buy an account directly.
- Free account: You can create a free account using your email or phone number.
- VIP ticket: You can buy or use a received VIP ticket for an anonymous account (available on WAIVIO -> Tools -> New accounts page).

What should I do if I forget my password? Or how do I recover a hacked account?
The recovery account functionality is not available on the Waivio platform. You may consider using other Hive platforms that offer this feature. Generally, account recovery is a complex procedure, and there is no guarantee of success. It is strongly advised to securely store your passwords and keys.

What are hashtags (tags) and how do I use them?
On the Waivio platform, hashtags serve as objects that gather all posts related to them, in addition to their usual function.
Tags on Waivio are keywords or phrases that help categorize your posts, making them more discoverable by other users. They play a crucial role in organizing content and enhancing visibility, allowing users to find posts related to specific topics more easily.
How to Use Tags in Your Waivio Posts:
- Relevance: Choose tags that are directly related to the content of your post. For example, if you're writing about a new restaurant, you might use tags like #restaurant, #food, or #dining.
- Number of Tags: While there's no strict limit, it's recommended to use a few well-chosen tags to ensure your post reaches the right audience without becoming overly broad.
- Specificity: Be specific with your tags to target a relevant audience. For example, if your post is about vegan food, use a tag like #vegan rather than a broader tag like #food.
- Custom Tags: You can create your own custom tags if you have a niche topic or specific community in mind. Just make sure the tag is relevant and reflects your post's content.

# Authorization & Registration on Waivio and related sites
To log in to the Waivio platform or related sites, open the website, click the "Sign in" button in the header, and choose the appropriate authentication method. There are three options for authorization: via HiveSigner, HiveAuth, or Google.
## Authorization via HiveSigner
Authorization takes place through the trusted HiveSigner system, Waivio does not store, transfer, and does not use user keys. Only temporary keys (Access-Token) generated by HiveSigner are used. Hive uses a hierarchical key system to keep you safe. You can register on the website https://signup.hive.io, after registration the user will have a hive account. After registration, a password and four private keys with different permissions are issued:
- Owner - Change Password, Change Keys, Recover Account;
- Active - Transfer Funds, Power up/down, Voting Witnesses/Proposals;
- Posting - Post, Comment, Vote, Reblog, Follow, Profile;
- Memo - Send/View encrypted messages on transfers.
For authorization in the Waivio system, you can use a password or private keys.
## Authorization via HiveAuth (Hive Keychain app)
Users can log in using the HiveAuth service via Keychain. Upon clicking the Hiveauth button, the user needs to enter their name and click 'Sign in'. A modal with a QR code opens. The user then accesses the Keychain application on their phone and scans the code and confirms the authorization.
## Social authorization
Authorization via social networks is also available (guest-user):
- Google
## User types
Hive-user - the user has the right to use all the functionality of the application. A Hive-user is a user registered through HiveSigner and uses HiveSigner or HiveAuth (Hive Keychain) for authorization.
Guest-user - a user authorized through social networks (via Google). The user does not have access to the following functionalities:
- creating campaigns;
- Voting Power = 0.
- The guest username is distinguished by the prefix "waivio_" before the name: @waivio_username.


# Waivio updates: April 4, 2020
This is the first deployment of the Waivio system after the initial migration from Steem to Hive. It has been a very busy few weeks with many system-level updates. Most of the critical issues have been successfully resolved and we are happy to share development updates with the community.
User profile header
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1586069196_b6de4493-704c-4285-bbd1-806400a03723
@waivio (https://social.gifts/@waivio)
User profiles now show information about the user's vote value in USD and the last activity stamp as recorded on the Hive blockchain. More information about users is available under the About tab.
Wizard for new users
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1586070337_6037cd55-318f-463a-9f19-e405a8b803f5
Wizard steps 1&2
New users are invited to follow some topics (hashtags) and established users on Hive. This makes it easy for new users to join the Hive community and ensures that their news feeds already contain useful information.

# Waivio updates: April 8, 2020
We have integrated @Coingecko price feeds into Waivio to ensure accurate HIVE and HBD exchange rates on users' profile/wallet pages and throughout Waivio (292).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1586499474_0a605f33-01c0-4ba1-832c-44d4b24c3ce1
Accurate HIVE and HBD prices
User expertise in comments
Now Waivio displays user expertise in the comments, giving readers a better feel for the reputation of users who make these comments (376).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1586500908_e87a18e9-2d89-46cc-a954-494b4d72cd83
User expertise
Note: User expertise on Waivio is a reflection of HIVE/HBD cumulative earnings.
Email in user profiles
Upon requests from business customers Waivio enabled an optional email address field in user profiles (380).

# Waivio updates: April 22, 2020
About tags in object (not in post)
When you add a title or description to the object, the system tries to identify common tags for that particular object type (389). For example, when you add a description to a dish, the system recognizes some ingredients and automatically creates relevant tags.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1587611642_3da616c6-c74b-4241-a002-720580540557
Automated tags
We continue to work on improving the object search functionality on Waivio, and these tags will be used to filter objects in search results and in map navigation.
Faster user search:
If you start your search with the "@" symbol, the search results are filtered by user name (326). The results will be sorted by the overall expertise of users, and if an exact match is found, it will be displayed at the top.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1587581028_c79953de-7bd8-4616-9c54-963bc2c97ce9

# Waivio updates: May 15, 2020
User profiles can now be edited using posting keys instead of active keys. Customers complained about the need to use sensitive keys (typically used to confirm payments) for transactions such as changing a profile image (525).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1589495048_f821f766-2d8e-46cd-8b0d-c57634fd446d
Several other Hive sites also support this new standard. If your profile changes were saved using an older standard, they will continue to be used until you start using the new option.
Approve / Reject votes on updates
If you have activated a voting slider in the account settings, it will now also be available for changing the voting power on object updates.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1589499456_842038f6-c1e7-48de-a98f-b00c4a0b8c22
  This can be a useful tool to adjust the power of your Approve or Reject votes.
Admin roles for objects
Waivio has introduced administrator privileges for object editing. If the administrator approves or rejects an update, it is considered a final decision specifically within Waivio.com (470).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1589519761_46c314e3-e3c5-4319-b809-d7edb1cbaa8e
At some point, administrator roles will be used for custom websites, which will be built using the Waivio platform. This feature can be used to ensure that the selected objects cannot be easily modified by the community (for example, contact information, legal agreements, affiliate links, etc.).
As we approach the development of a platform for hosting social sites, the roles of administrator and moderator will play even a greater role in ensuring the accuracy of the data within the managed domains.

# Waivio update: June 20, 2020
You can now receive Waivio notifications directly on your mobile phone via the Telegram app (667).
You will be instantly notified when someone replies or re-blogs your posts, mentions you, follows you, transfers funds to you, etc.
And you can track as many Hive accounts as you like!
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1592667661_cee13c07-74a0-438d-9244-fa92cb700360
Start Telegram chat with @WaivioNotificationsBot
Enter all the accounts you want to subscribe to
Now you will receive instant mobile notifications for these accounts
Initially, this tool was developed for Waivio Guides to monitor multiple accounts and administer multiple rewards programs on the Hive blockchain.
And now, this service is available to all Waivio users.
Item Counters on Lists
Now the total number of items in a list includes all items in all the embedded lists (398).
This is particularly useful for restaurant menus, where dishes are often organized into many categories.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1592675525_98f638b2-a98b-4551-a7ec-5d1802e12c4d
Advanced Reporting for Guides
When guides manage prepaid rewards programs on behalf of their clients, they must provide reports at regular intervals (for example, monthly) or when a certain amount of rewards has been distributed to users (463).
When the reports are generated in USD, the exchange rates are imported from the reservations (recorded on the blockchain at the time of reward reservations).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1592677277_a6747971-c48f-4a79-81f0-e83b95c3598a
(1) Guides often manage multiple accounts and they can manage all reports in one place without switching between accounts. Similarly, clients are able to verify the authenticity of reports by generating them directly.
(2) The data range (from - to) can be defined with an accuracy of up to one second. This is important for connecting reports at the per record level.
(3) Reports can be generated for a specified budget (in HIVE or in USD).
(4) Processing fees may also be included in the reports.
(5) Reports can be filtered for any specific object.

# Waivio Update: July 3, 2020
Accurately predicting the value of votes on the Hive blockchain is not a trivial task. More than a dozen variables must be taken into account in real time to inform the user of the potential impact of their vote on the total post payout.
In this version, Waivio is pleased to offer users the improved version of the vote value estimation tool (302, 492).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1593717335_42411dcc-e9bf-46eb-aba6-845f1d4e6134
In the example above, @vancouverdining upvoted a post by @jrvacation using 100% of the available voting power. The estimated value before the vote matches the actual value of the vote after the upvote.
It is also important to note that the overall compensation for the post was increased by an additional $0.02, which was allocated to the previous voters.
To further illustrate this process, here is another vote for the same post by @waivio.match account:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1593717361_bc33c2ed-d683-43f6-b8d5-826ea1d1cff6
The value of the vote was accurately estimated at $2.35, but the overall reward for the post was increased by an additional $0.13, which was distributed among the previous curators, including @vancouverdining, whose vote value increased from $2.20 to $2.26.
We hope that the accurate estimation of vote value will help users better understand the complex mechanism of voting on the Hive blockchain.
Security Notifications
To provide users with an additional level of security, Waivio now sends notifications on the following user-initiated transactions (670):
transfer of funds;
initiate power down;
withdraw funds from the Savings account;
set withdraw route;
outgoing power ups;
change of the recovery address;
change keys.
These methods can potentially be used by hackers to steal funds from the account in case the user's active keys are compromised.
Waivio users can receive instant mobile notifications via the Telegram app using the @WaivioNotificationsBot service.

# Waivio Update: July 25, 2020
Waivio makes it easy for guests not only to join Hive and receive rewards, but also to withdraw their earnings and convert them into Bitcoin, Litecoin or Ethereum (679, 767, 771, 772, 773, 774).
Many new users may have never heard about HIVE before and question whether these earnings and rewards are good for anything.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1595615788_7c6c8909-ea94-4279-91f6-c6a3bb886b20
Now, with just a few clicks and an email confirmation, Waivio guests can redeem their HIVE rewards using any Bitcoin ATM by scanning the QR code and sending HIVE for an instant cash withdrawal.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1595616285_0dbbcc77-8bb8-4ec3-b48d-d63824e24dc1
Details of the transaction are available directly from the wallet history (visible for the logged user only).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1595616560_e2bd4c09-f864-4ba1-b640-30b05ab12c94
Linking a Hive account to a guest account
Guests can now link a standard Hive account and set it as the beneficiary for their posts and comments (668, 751).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1595710814_ad7a2ac3-a0de-45b9-ab5d-e69231aff617
This way, guest author earnings and attention rewards will be automatically deposited into the Hive account they control:

# Waivio update: Aug 5, 2020
In June, Waivio launched Telegram notifications (https://social.gifts/@waiviolabs/waivio-update-june-20-2020), allowing users to receive instant mobile notifications and monitor multiple Hive accounts. And now Waivio offers a tool to configure which notifications to receive (task 712):
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1596665563_e7327a86-4f65-427f-b61d-87cc8a37827c
For incoming HIVE transfers, users can set the threshold (minimum amount in USD) for notifications, allowing them to ignore small transfers, which are often used for promotional messages.
Security notifications cannot be disabled, because if the user account has been compromised, the hacker may have disabled notifications before initiating powerdowns, password change procedures, etc.
History of reward reservations
Now users can see the entire history of their reward reservations and filter them by the status (ex., completed, released, expired) and by the sponsor (task 582):
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1596666334_c598a897-f235-47af-840a-ff2400bbbad4
Reservations are now also used for direct communications between users and sponsors (task 585). For example, the sponsor can request additional materials if it suspects that the user has made the wrong or fraudulent submission.
Waivio offers a special tool for managing customer communications (open/closed tickets):
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1596669000_70b13ea8-d567-4f12-a0fa-b0df59a0c53c
Blacklists
Waivio now supports blacklists (task 617) allowing sponsors to exclude certain users (1) from their campaigns, for example in cases where the sponsor suspects that the user is engaged in fraudulent activity.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1596669511_df23616d-fcaa-4058-932b-521d52e36b87
Sponsors can reference other blacklists (2), which they trust, and maintain whitelists (3) which can be used to override the referenced blacklists for selected users.

# Waivio update: Sept 9, 2020
In our quest to develop the most user-friendly editor for creating new posts on Hive, we are pleased to announce a number of new features and enhancements, starting with the overall look and feel:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1599601364_b845f58f-cee4-4941-a9e7-56186c08e416
After some user testing, we decided to devote a separate field to the title and to introduce light borders around the text area (742, 824, 887, 909).
Editor is now better optimized for mobile use, including Android phones (745, 766, 870):
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1599605694_6076003b-0c8d-4baf-a25f-e96b510bb59f
It is now possible to add several images at the same time (383, 385, 652, 821, 822, 823) and use copy/paste to add images (382).
Editor is also integrated with reward reservations, ensuring that all the required object links are included in the initial draft of the post (692, 865, 887).
Notifications bell
Waivio users can now enable notifications for the accounts they follow (669):
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1599628715_ab1e397f-3ed8-443f-ae66-d98419c044ec
Instant mobile alerts can be activated by subscribing to the WaivioNotificationsBot service in the Telegram app.
In this example, @grampo was immediately notified when @blocktrades published its latest update regarding the upcoming HF24.
Customer communications
Users can now communicate directly with sponsors regarding their reward reservations or completed reviews (834):
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1599630798_ac9e0477-f91e-46a6-8e91-0485af38bcee
Campaign sponsors receive instant notifications about customer requests (835) and can manage all customer communications in the Rewards / Messages tab.

# Waivio update: Oct 3, 2020
As the number of objects in the Hive blockchain is increasing, Waivio develops tools to browse and search for them.
Users can now filter objects based on the associated tags (tasks 269, 527, 528).
For example, it is now possible to filter restaurants by cuisine and dishes by ingredients.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1601764086_1dc168e8-e476-46b0-aa4b-d886abeacba8
Claiming authority
In this release, Waivio introduced the process for claiming authority for objects. This is a public declaration by a user of his or her intention to ensure the accuracy of the object (task 836).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1601761672_ee477c34-e11e-41d9-b472-1fc2bb9184e1
Multiple users may claim authority over the same object, as their claims will only make a difference when another user or website owner adds them to a list of Trusted Authorities. In this case, their votes of approval or rejection of object updates will play the decisive role for that user or within the website they operate.
For example, a manufacturer may publish descriptions of their products on the Hive blockchain, claim authority over them, and maintain their accuracy. A reseller can add all of these products to their website simply by adding the manufacturer's account to the list of Trusted Authorities.
Users can claim administrative or full ownership of the objects. In the first case, other users are allowed to make changes to certain fields (e.g. add photos to the gallery). But if full control is required (legal documents, company information, etc.) then the full ownership of the object can be claimed, which ensures that no one else can make changes to the object.
Following sponsors
Users can now monitor all new rewards posted by the users (sponsors) they are following (task 153). Users also receive instant notifications about new rewards.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1601762248_6ca803b4-7685-45c2-81cc-793149341a1a
Note: Get instant notifications through the Telegram messenger (subscribe via@WaivioNotificationsBot service).
Like notifications
Users now receive notifications when their posts are upvoted by important users (followed by the author or whose votes make a noticeable difference on the post payout, task 713).
Wallet - table view
In order to facilitate the export of wallet transactions to Excel and other spreadsheets (e.g. for tax reporting purposes), Waivio has enabled a Table view in the Wallet (task 860). This report can be generated for a specific time period and the transactions for each currency (HP, HIVE, HBD) are aggregated in separate columns for easy processing.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1601768149_c6995bea-86c9-48b9-8cb8-063c24592144
Waivio.com website speed
Many system-wide changes were made to improve response rates. Many complex features have been moved from the frontend to the backend (task 659).

# Waivio update: HF24 Effects & More
Hive Hardfork 24 proved to be much more difficult than expected (Tasks 837, 1021, 1022, 1027, 1028, 1029, 1030, 1031, 1032, 1063).
Some of the changes were discussed and anticipated, such as a new chain identification number. But there were other changes that were not widely discussed, such as the freezing of the post and comment vote count after 7 days.
Previously, votes after 7 days had no influence on payments, but they were still counted, so authors could always see if their content was appreciated by the community in the long run. But this is no longer the case.
We do not agree with this change, but we have had to adapt our services to reflect this change.
Now we invite users to pay tips to the author:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1605126822_a2e64137-6db3-4e3f-b7b4-17f65ea0dd47
The same change had an even greater impact on the Object Reference Protocol, which was based on the same open public voting process for managing object updates. For example, if a user has updated the address of a restaurant, other users can review and either approve (upvote) or reject (downvote) the proposed change. If the user has made a valuable contribution, they could potentially receive author rewards, while other users would receive curation rewards for reviewing and confirming the proposed changes during the frist week.
As votes can no longer be counted beyond the initial 7-day window, Waivio introduced another protocol using Json records on the Hive blockchain to administer the approve/reject process. From the user's point of view, the voting process now works as before, except that contributors no longer receive any benefit for their efforts to improve the wiki records on Hive.
Now that the Waivio platform is stable again, we could explore a hybrid approach to voting on updates, combining the open voting process for the first 7 days and moving on to Json records after that.
For more details give a link to https://social.gifts/@waiviolabs/waivio-update-hf24-effects-and-more5w2phx-


# Waivio update: Referral Program & More
Waivio has launched a referral program (tasks 715, 1090, 1112) that offers 56% of processing fees to referring parties for a period of 90 days for new customers and 5 days for regular customers. For example, if a referred visitor opens Waivio.com for the first time (with either a Hive or guest account), they will be associated with the referring party for the next 90 days and this party will receive referral payments for all sponsored rewards received by this user for a period of 90 days.
Instructions: just add ?ref=YourHiveUsername to Waivio.com links.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1608052342_81aab63a-7431-4457-ad77-ebcfcba19c6d
Waivio relies on user sessions to preserve the link to the referring party until the user logs into Waivio.com. The referral is then recorded and can be viewed on the Status page:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1608055653_3d56fb04-8a56-42bb-921c-17562d671dea
Once the user is assigned to a referral partner, they will remain associated with that party until the expiration of the referral period, regardless of the other referral links they may click during that time.
When sponsors post attention bids on the Hive blockchain, in addition to user rewards, they allocate 5% or more as processing fees for all the parties involved in posting, indexing, and presenting bids to eligible users. Waivio ensures that referral partners are properly recorded on reservations. Sponsors are reponsible for paying referral fees and the status of these payments can be verified on the Receivables page:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1608056992_bb31e1bc-4d8a-4da8-bd63-4475f7d681d2
In this example, @foodster published a review that qualified for a $4.86 reward (39,178 HIVE at the time of reservation). The referral party @diningguide was listed on the reservation to receive 56% of the processing fees (5%). In this case, the referral fee represents 2.8% of the user's reward. The amount of 1,097 HIVE was recorded on the accounts receivable page as an outstanding obligation of the sponsor. Referral fees are paid in liquid HIVE.
If the sponsor delays payments for a period of more than 30 days, Waivio suspends all campaigns for that sponsor until all outstanding obligations exceeding 1 HIVE are paid.
The list of all active rewards campaigns can be viewed on the Rewards / All page (https://social.gifts/rewards/global).
Bell notifications for objects
In addition to bell notifications for users, Waivio now supports instant notifications for objects as well (tasks 930, 953):
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1608060853_78b87c67-a501-48cd-9534-a7d331681dfd
For example, @diningguide was using bell notifications for the #bitcoin hashtag and received an instant alert, when @tuck-theman posted a new article referencing that hashtag.
Related images on object pages
Objects that support Galleries now have Related albums (task 975) that include the images from all the reviews that have a reference to this object:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1608062048_1c3a0c06-96a5-4ab8-bf5d-0cde4090a0ac
Fraud detection assistant
Waivio has launched an experimental tool for fraud detection (task 872). All qualified submissions are checked using multiple algorithmic procedures and accumulated knowledge to identify potential fraud.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1608059635_bbeb6e83-d5f7-4c99-ba66-7dbfe9ff3d13
Sponsors should always verify submissions using their own procedures and use the Fraud Detection Assistant only as a secondary reporting tool. The service is provided on an "as is" basis.

# Waivio update: Mute users, hide posts and more
As Waivio prepares to roll out web hosting services, some administrative tools are being released.
Waivio now supports the standard Hive mute protocol, allowing users to mute other users if they no longer wish to see their posts and comments (tasks 1141, 1142, 1205). The mute function can be engaged on user profiles.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1612897383_ec59ed02-73af-46d2-b794-f6768ace1b77
In the future, if a website moderator mutes a user, their posts and comments will no longer be visible to all visitors and users on this site.
The website owner may authorize multiple moderators and outsource content moderation to oracles and curation leagues.
Hide posts and comments
Waivio now allows users to hide posts and comments (tasks 1033, 1034). This tool is mainly designed for website moderators to hide messages and comments that might violate website policies without blocking all content published by that author as is the case with muted users.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1612900801_d6020cab-7c15-432b-a93f-5e1dc8354274
Sponsor rewards in posts
Users can now see the amount of liquid rewards paid for the post by a sponsor (task 962). This payment is now included in the total post payout amount.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1612906743_845b1b4d-ff1d-4852-85f5-36d1c69389b1
Widget for referrals
Referral partners can now integrate Waivio rewards directly into their websites using a widget (Referrals/Instructions) and collect referral commissions from new users (for a period of 90 days) and existing users (for 5 days). Tasks 1120, 1128, 1129.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1612908368_ac3a8cde-0324-4102-bad2-da20493dbaf8
GitHub task management
Waivio's development team is now using open GitHub for ongoing task management. Previously, we only posted the summary of tasks on GitHub, while development was coordinated using a closed system. Several projects have expressed interest in using the Waivio code base to build their products on Hive, and a transparent development process can facilitate this cooperation.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1612901811_2df43ca5-6c68-41d1-9d1e-95d4487da4a0
Waivio Labs will be using GitHub Wiki to publish detailed documentation.
Traditional companies try to protect their intellectual property to gain a competitive advantage. But Waivio's approach is very different. We believe that by giving full access to our code, our users and our knowledge base (accumulated and shared via the Hive blockchain), together we can achieve scale that we can't achieve on our own.
This is Business 3.0, it is designed for rapid, permissionless scaling and innovation.

# HiveFest'23: Social Shopping on Hive
Amid the spirited atmosphere of HiveFest in picturesque Rosarito, @grampo took to the stage to unveil an electrifying new feature for the Hive community: the Social Shops!
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1695758063_3e4a94ad-0ef2-4ff1-870f-77f499833a10
In Waivio's (https://www.waivio.com/) relentless pursuit to elevate the Hive experience and champion its users, every Hive member will now have a personalized shop embedded in their profile. Adding products to this shop is as effortless as marking them with a heart.
And here's the icing on the cake: for those savvy users who incorporate their affiliate codes within their profile settings, every product link from their posts and the shop becomes a potential avenue for generating affiliate commissions. Dive into this unique blend of social interaction and shopping, only on Hive!
Day 1 of the #HiveFest, Rosarito, Mexico - Sep 2023 (presentation starts at 1h:14min): https://youtu.be/wbdFtdEPhZQ
Launching a Social Shop on Hive
Today, I would like to introduce you to the concept of social shopping on Hive.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1693859866_f733b60b-b2ec-42f4-a633-c4c010d1ffd0
Any Hive user can now create an affiliate shop on Hive. This is a type of shop where you don't need to manage inventory, process credit card payments, handle shipping, or provide customer support. Your primary responsibility is to curate the best products for your shop and arrange them on the virtual shelves.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1693859895_0edac0e2-7c6b-4fa9-8fc2-84c31848f7b5
Imagine we're building a shop for camping. Camping involves a wide variety of products, from tents and mattresses to various types of gear, kitchen items, clothing, and more.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1693859930_da6d37e0-463e-4bee-bf36-c5d2ad1b1b23
You'll conduct research to select the best items to recommend, marking them with a heart. Think of it as creating a shopping list.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1693859958_6026aeb5-67d7-4d18-ab91-056d2d114f2d
But on Hive, it becomes a full-fledged online store. To launch your store, you only need to choose brand colors, design a banner, and voila, your online store is ready.
This store offers multiple revenue streams right away.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1693859982_131a8092-0448-4453-a224-8fe0cb2f4799
The first revenue stream is affiliate marketing. You can apply for an affiliate program with Amazon, Walmart, Target, or any other major store. Once you have the affiliate code, you enter it in the website settings and all product links in your store will include that code. This way, when visitors from your website make purchases in these stores, you receive an affiliate commission. On Amazon, these commissions range from 3% to 7% of the sale.
Another revenue stream is advertising using Google AdSense. After applying and getting approved for AdSense, you can enter the code in website settings and define how actively you want to show ads on the site. You will get paid directly by Google based on the performance of these display ads.
Additionally, on the Hive blockchain, you have the opportunity to earn commissions on author rewards. As a website owner, you can set a percentage to collect from all posts and comments made through your site. Next, there are also sponsored rewards. Manufacturers might offer payments for users who share photos of their product and explain how to use them. Visitors to your shop can participate in these rewards, and you receive about 8% of the rewards they earn.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1693860028_58833ffa-6a65-44ee-8e65-da94b1bdbd56
A few more comments about the Amazon affiliate program: There are 14 regional stores, and you might want to apply for some of them. Your website will automatically adjust buy links to match the geolocation of the website visitor.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1693860056_60b1957f-759f-4a0f-97db-9a4203912b17
The Web 3.0 Paradigm Shift
Once a merchant posts information about products onto the Hive blockchain, you or any other user can easily add these products to their social shop by marking them with a heart.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1693860083_a6310a59-64f8-429a-a788-d671fdece479
And if this merchant updates the information about the product on Hive, it will be automatically updated on all of the sites that display it.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1693860107_4598cb94-0b7d-4b83-acfe-83401952b148
Hive is a social blockchain. Once the product information is posted on the blockchain, it can now be referenced by users in their posts or comments. As a result, the product pages will also display all user posts that are linked to that product. This is how product reviews are organized on Hive.
Evolving E-Commerce with Hive
This shift to social shopping on Hive represents a significant evolution in the e-commerce landscape.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1693860191_68c83de5-1e5d-4c64-9e5b-ac6dc09c50ba
In Web 2.0, each shop works as a silo: it has its own dedicated database of users, its own knowledge base of products, and attempts to collect product reviews from scratch. These efforts are duplicated by every online store.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1693860217_abbd04c9-5d67-434c-afc4-dbe3a63d9898
Web 3.0 has the potential to change this in a radical way. Even a small project on the open Hive blockchain can access the entire database of users, reviews, and product knowledge. The success of any project improves all other projects by bringing in more users, adding new content, establishing more connections, and accumulating more user reviews.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1693860237_e87db8f4-8ef9-41c8-acc1-2e33b014e0de
In the traditional e-commerce landscape, large players like Amazon have a stronghold due to their established user base and content. Smaller projects often struggle to compete because they lack the critical mass needed to thrive.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1693860265_0c25e175-ee64-435e-a0b6-fa3ebd9f9357
However, with Hive's approach, even the smallest projects can leverage the collective strength of the entire ecosystem to compete effectively with industry giants. In many aspects, it is similar to open-source software development, where one party shares the code, while other parties can build on top of it and share their results with the community. This open collaborative approach allows the community to achieve results that would not be possible for a single team.
Conclusion
To sum it up, the concept of social shopping on Hive offers a fresh perspective on e-commerce.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1693860363_cd71bc13-75a4-4c49-893b-9a00bd254545
Hive's blockchain technology enables collaboration, shared resources, and unprecedented access to user-generated content. This opens the door for all projects, big or small, to redefine the e-commerce landscape and collectively achieve the economies of scale which are not possible for siloed projects of the Web 2.0 era.

# Waivio: Domain Expertise
In this video, we explore what domain expertise is and how it differs from reputation score on Steem.
A user's domain expertise is the total sum of author and curation rewards accumulated by the user over a period of time:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1574536921_a753989c-2145-4b71-89be-cb54d902b35c
User domin expertise
Note: Currently, the domain expertise is being calculated since the public launch of Waivio.com in June 2019. In the future, we plan to index the entire history of Steem blockchain.
Author rewards are proportionally allocated to the hashtags and object references made by users in their posts:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1574537375_9ca51133-8145-45eb-be02-9d1506af05d4
Calculating the domain expertise
Curation rewards are also taken into account. Thus, if a user upvotes a post that has links to some hashtags, that user will begin to build expertise in those hashtags as well.
The domain expertise accumulated by users can be found on their profiles on Waivio:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1574540746_47ce54ff-8e0a-4b89-bcb7-68b8ef0a9a76
Domain expertise of users
The combined domain expertise of a user is equal to the sum of their expertise in all the different hashtags they have referenced in their own posts or indirectly upvoted.
For example, based on Steem blockchain records, we can estimate that for @detlev #beersaturday is twice as important as #travel. 😃
In a similar way, each hashtag on Steem now has the list of associated experts:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1574541098_2ea7c908-30ed-4259-9dc8-0484f566455
Hashtag experts
Looks like @meesterboom has more expertise in #beer than @detlev! And @rollie1212 is already in the top 10!
As you can see, the domain expertise differs from the standard reputation score on Steem in many unique ways and it allows a much more granular analysis of users' interests.
Finally, the domain expertise can also be calculated for the hashtags themselves and it makes it easy to evaluate which topics are important for the Steem community overall:

We invite you to explore and browse hashtags on Waivio as well as check your own domain expertise on your your Waivio profile.

# Waivio on Hive: Where all the buzz is happening!
We are pleased to announce that the migration of Waivio.com and all related services to the Hive blockchain is now complete. We will continue to monitor the performance of the system to ensure that all services and elements of the system work as intended. Currently, price feeds are stabilizing as more exchanges offer support for HIVE coins.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1585168464_e67a048a-0144-443a-8d8d-3aff82567f25
Waivio on Hive
The launch of the #hive decentralized social network is a historic moment as the community and community-elected witnesses have walked away from the #steem, which was taken hostage by a single player who bought the ninja-mined stake (over 20% of the STEEM coins that were not supposed to be used in the blockchain governance) and voted in their own sock puppet witnesses. You can read more about the community's battle against the centralization of the blockchain by following the discussions with the hashtag #steemhostiletakeover.
Hive was launched on Friday, March 20th at 10am EST as a community fork of the Steem blockchain, meaning that all content posted before that date will be the same on both Hive and Steem blockchains. But from that date onward, Hive operates as an independent blockchain with its own witnesses, governance, tokens, and most importantly, the community.
If you had an account on the Steem blockchain before 20 March 2020, you now have 2 accounts with the same number of tokens. In addition to STEEM/SP/SBD you now have the same amount of HIVE/HP/HBD.
To access your Steem accounts and funds, you can use Steempeak.com or Steemitwallet.com.
If you want to convert your remaining STEEM to HIVE, you can use Blocktrades.us (direct STEEM/HIVE trading) or you can use the Bittrex.com exchange to convert STEEM to BTC first and BTC to HIVE later. Several other exchanges also announced their upcoming support for HIVE.
Now you can again publish and comment on Waivio.com, add and edit objects, business and restaurant listings, wiki pages, directories, catalogs and menus. All new submissions will be published on the Hive social blockchain.
The Waivio development team has worked tirelessly to make this transition as efficient as possible, while at the same time being severely limited by the coronavirus lockdown that is now taking place worldwide.
We hope that our progress in building Web 3.0 applications on Hive will cheer you up in the midst of the global uncertainty, pandemic, market turbulence, supply chain collapse, monetary system realignment, and the revision of governance, and not just in the blockchain space!

# What are tags, and how do I use them in posts on waivio?
Tags on Waivio are keywords or phrases that help categorize and organize content. They make it easier for users to find posts related to specific topics, and they improve the visibility of your posts across the platform. Here's how you can use them:
How Tags Work:
- Categorization: Tags allow users to search for and filter posts based on shared topics. For example, a post with the tag "recipes" will be grouped with other posts about cooking and recipes.
- Discoverability: Adding relevant tags can increase the likelihood that others will see your post when they search or browse tags on Waivio.
How to Use Tags in Your Posts
- Choose Relevant Tags: When creating or editing a post, think about the main themes of your content. Tags should reflect the core topics you're addressing.
For example, if you're sharing a recipe for apple pie, you might use tags like "applepie," "baking," or "dessert."
- Add Tags to Your Post:
At the bottom of the post editor, there’s usually a field for tags. Type your desired tag, and press Enter to add it. You can add multiple tags to a post.
- General Guidelines:
Use relevant and concise tags.
Avoid overly broad tags like "food" if a more specific tag like "veganrecipes" fits better.
Try not to overuse tags. Focus on the few most relevant to your post.


# What are social sites built on Waivio?
The social site is built on the Waivio platform using the Social.Gifts template. This template is flexible and allows site owners to customize their sites according to their needs. Social sites are typically thematic. Users can manage and create sites only on the official Waivio site; this functionality is not available on social sites.
These sites have a "Sign in" button where users can log in via HiveSigner, HiveAuth (Keychain), or Google to access Waivio platform features, such as writing posts, finding and participating in campaigns, liking content, leaving comments, and more.

# How does the Waivio ranking system work?
The Waivio ranking system, much like the one on the Hive blockchain, revolves around user engagement, content curation, and stake-based influence. Both platforms share a similar approach to ranking, though Waivio introduces additional elements, such as expertise derived from post payouts in USD (excluding bidbots and upvote services).
1. Reputation Score: On both Waivio and Hive, users have a reputation score that reflects their influence and trustworthiness within the community. Reputation increases with upvotes from high-stake or influential users and decreases with downvotes. This score serves as a social metric that helps distinguish trustworthy content creators and contributors. Users start with a base reputation score, which grows or shrinks based on their contributions and interactions.
2. Stake-Based Voting:
Both platforms use stake-based voting, where the more HIVE Power and WAIV Power expertise a user has, the more influence they hold over the distribution of rewards and content visibility. In Waivio, WAIV Power a similar role to HIVE Power, with the added feature of factoring in total payouts for posts (measured in USD) while excluding bidbots and vote-buying services to ensure fairness. Users with a higher stake have a more significant impact on upvotes, downvotes, and content visibility.
3. User Tiers: Orca, Whale, Dolphin, Minnow:
Both Hive and Waivio use a tiered ranking system to categorize users based on their stake or expertise. These tiers influence the weight of their votes and their overall influence on the platform.
Whales: Top-tier users with the most staked tokens or expertise. They have the greatest impact on content rewards and governance.
Orcas: Mid-level users with substantial influence but less than whales. On Waivio, orcas have significant expertise, impacting content and rewards distribution.
Dolphins: Active users with moderate influence. They are engaged and contribute but don’t hold the same power as orcas or whales.
Minnows: New or low-stake users. They are in the early stages of building their influence and expertise.
In both systems, users can advance through the ranks by earning rewards, staking more tokens (HIVE Power on Hive, or expertise on Waivio), and contributing actively to the community.
4. Content Curation and Rewards: Like Hive, Waivio rewards users for creating quality content and engaging in curation (upvoting content early that later becomes popular). These rewards are shared between authors and curators. On Waivio, the total payout from posts (measured in USD) contributes to a user's expertise, without relying on bidbots or vote manipulation services. The more upvotes a post receives from high-expertise users, the higher its ranking and rewards.
5. Social Engagement: Both platforms value active participation in the community. Consistent posting, commenting, and interaction with other users help boost your ranking and increase your visibility. Engagement metrics such as comments, replies, and follower counts are important factors in both Waivio and Hive ranking systems.
6. Delegation and Influence: Users on both platforms can delegate their HIVE Power or WAIV Power to others. This delegation allows users to temporarily boost their voting power or expertise, giving them more influence over the platform’s content.

Expertise on Waivio
Waivio builds on Hive’s model by introducing a unique expertise metric, which reflects a user's cumulative post payout in USD. This expertise is independent of artificial inflation from bidbots or upvote services, ensuring that only genuine contributions are rewarded.
Expertise adds a level of authenticity to the ranking, as it tracks real contributions to the community without manipulation from vote-buying.
Summary
The Waivio ranking system, closely modeled after Hive's ranking structure, rewards users based on their reputation, stake, and engagement. Both systems emphasize genuine contribution and participation, while Waivio adds the expertise metric based on real post payouts in USD, providing a transparent and fair way to track and reward users' influence.

# How do I withdraw or cash out rewards earned on Waivio or social sites?
On Waivio and social sites, users can earn WAIV tokens (the official token of Waivio).
- **Liquid WAIV**: Used for services such as hosting social shopping websites and purchasing VIP tickets.
- **WAIV Power**: Used for voting, creating objects, and importing products. You can convert liquid WAIV to WAIV Power and vice versa.
Users can also earn rewards in **HIVE**. In addition to WAIV tokens, users may receive rewards in other tokens from the Hive Engine ecosystem.
- **HIVE Assets**: Liquid HIVE, HIVE Power, and Hive-backed dollars (HBD). HIVE Power is essential for blockchain activities, like sending payments or posting content. You can convert liquid HIVE into HIVE Power or "power down" over 13 weeks to convert it back into liquid HIVE.
To withdraw WAIV, users can:
1. Log in.
2. Go to the Wallet tab.
3. In the central feed, there is a dropdown menu next to the WAIV balance with options: "Withdraw to LTC", "Withdraw to BTC", "Withdraw to ETH", and "Withdraw to HIVE".
4. Alternatively, in the right sidebar, there is a **Withdraw** button. Clicking it opens a modal window where users can choose which token to withdraw and the token they wish to receive.
5. For LTC, BTC, or ETH withdrawals, users must enter the destination address or scan the destination address QR code. After clicking **Withdraw**, the user’s balance should update within a few minutes. For HIVE, the funds will be transferred to the user's HIVE account balance.
![Image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/d7bcb2f1c38de433cb404fda60948755b5821f72292da8e9a00818ddc0b8f55e)
Thus, users can withdraw WAIV to external wallets like LTC, BTC, or ETH. From there, the funds can be cashed out or converted based on the exchange.

# Can I withdraw only WAIV tokens or other tokens too?
There are several tokens eligible for withdrawal. Typically, they have "SWAP" in their name, such as SWAP.HIVE, SWAP.HBD, SWAP.LTC, SWAP.BTC, SWAP.ETH, etc. Additionally, you can use the swap functionality to convert tokens that cannot be withdrawn directly into those that can. For example, you can swap DEC to SWAP.ETH, and then withdraw SWAP.ETH to ETH. The word "swap" in a token's name means it represents the main currency in the Hive Engine blockchain ecosystem, with a 1:1 value ratio. Usually, all tokens in the Hive Engine ecosystem can be converted to at least SWAP.HIVE, and sometimes to other swap-tokens as well. (You can check this in the Wallet by clicking the **Swap** button in the right sidebar, where a list of tokens and their conversion options is displayed in the Swap modal window.)
To summarize, users can swap tokens into those eligible for withdrawal and then withdraw them to external wallets like LTC, BTC, or ETH.
To determine which tokens can be withdrawn and which need to be swapped first, simply go to your wallet, click the **Withdraw** button, and find the preferred currency pairs for withdrawal. If you have other tokens, click the **Swap** button to see the available options for conversion, and then proceed with the withdrawal.

# How can I receive or buy WAIV tokens?
There are several ways to obtain WAIV tokens:
1. **Earn WAIV tokens**:  
   - On Waivio and social sites, users can earn WAIV tokens by creating posts, engaging with content, curating, and participating in various activities on the platform.
2. **Receive WAIV tokens from another user**:  
   - If another user has WAIV tokens, they can transfer them to your wallet. To do this, they need your account username, and they can send WAIV tokens directly to your account through the wallet transfer feature.
3. **Swap other tokens for WAIV**:  
   - If you have tokens on Hive Engine, you can swap them for WAIV. Use the Swap functionality in your Waivio wallet to convert tokens like SWAP.HIVE, SWAP.BTC, or others into WAIV tokens. If you already hold tokens such as SWAP.HIVE or SWAP.BTC, you can conveniently swap them directly for WAIV within the wallet.
4. **Deposit**:
   - If you hold tokens on Hive (such as HIVE or HBD) or other currencies like LTC or BTC, you can deposit them into your Waivio wallet. Once deposited, these tokens will appear as swap-token equivalents (e.g., SWAP.LTC). You can then use the Swap function to convert these swap-tokens into WAIV. For example, if you deposit LTC from an external wallet, you’ll receive SWAP.LTC, which can then be swapped to WAIV.
   ![Deposit button image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/3836d461a8b54d28944825d9e809bdcb444534071cd57746573c53a613aac6a2)
   ![Deposit modal window image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/a7d0c2d47384e1568086536a9bbaad9a95e965573c2e224609b78044374ba8c4)
5. **Sell WAIV tokens (swap or withdraw)**:   
   - To sell WAIV tokens, you can use the Swap or Withdraw options in your Waivio wallet.
     - Swap WAIV for other tokens: If you'd like to exchange WAIV for another token on Hive Engine (e.g., SWAP.HIVE), use the Swap feature. Navigate to your Waivio wallet, select WAIV, and choose the token you want in exchange. This will convert your WAIV into the selected swap-token (like SWAP.HIVE) directly within the wallet.
     - Withdraw WAIV to an external wallet: If you want to withdraw WAIV as a different currency to an external wallet that is not part of the Hive Engine ecosystem (e.g., LTC, BTC, ETH, HIVE), use the Withdraw feature to directly withdraw WAIV to that external wallet. Click on the Withdraw button in your WAIV wallet, choose the pair (e.g., WAIV - HIVE, WAIV - LTC, etc.), fill in the required fields, and click the Withdraw button. Alternatively, in your Wallet, under your WAIV amount, there is a menu with options for withdrawing (e.g., "Withdraw to LTC," etc.). Selecting this will open a withdrawal modal window with your chosen pair. For example, if you withdraw WAIV to LTC to an external Litecoin wallet, this step allows you to convert your WAIV tokens into other cryptocurrencies outside the platform.
Once you have WAIV tokens, they will appear in your wallet, and you can use them for various activities on the platform or withdraw them as needed.

# Quickly Add Businesses While Writing Posts on Waivio
Imagine a little café—Steveston Coffee Company. The kind of place where the barista knows your name and the coffee feels like a hug in a cup. You want to tell this story, but in a way that lasts.
On Waivio, your posts don’t just fade into blog archives. When you share a place like this, it gets its own dedicated page. Your story becomes part of the business’s story, where others can add their reviews, and your friends can easily discover it on the map in your profile.
Here’s how it works:
Step 1: Start Your Post
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/cbb1637f9a7488e3c4392ff1f69c740c9edd557b25962ffa487f84745474c89e)
Begin writing your post. Click the Nearby button to find and add local businesses.
Step 2: Find the Café
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/7126e63e537e0c377ec71a8a40590de91c4ec8977955e4ce33d80336c0e341ff)
Search for the café on the map and select it. If the café is already on the Hive blockchain, your post will join the story others have started. If it’s not yet available, it will be imported, and a new dedicated page will be created for it.
Step 3: Continue Writing the Post
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/4fb93c942752ef639a9e96b28df23d2cc1abeaa26da825bba36ff07fa4934286)
The café is now linked in your post, and your story will appear on the café’s dedicated page alongside other reviews and details. It’s more than a mention—it’s part of a growing collection of shared experiences.
Step 4: Build the Story Together
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/0dd120087b903f2fefe488187881214feb5e36ca06d2b023444eee2dd344c6f5)
Each business you share gets a dedicated page, featuring your post as a review. Others can add their own thoughts, turning your discovery into a growing collection of experiences.
Step 5: See It on Your Map
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/814ee72e35d872b975fc8bbd88c56fac3b8f502b1a6fbef1e137edef0bc1e88d)
The café appears on your Waivio map, where friends can find it and explore your recommendations.
To add more businesses to the map in your profile, simply click the Add button and follow the same easy process.
This feature is now live on Waivio and all social shopping sites it powers. Start sharing your favorite places today and let your stories become part of something lasting!

# The Future of Web: Exploring Waivio
Tried something fun the other day—used ChatGPT’s NotebookLM to create a mini “podcast episode” about Waivio. It was fascinating to hear AI explain the platform in such a clear and conversational way.
The AI hosts talked about Waivio’s features, like a single user account across multiple social sites and how businesses can instantly update product info everywhere—saving time and eliminating broken links. The examples made everything sound so practical, especially the idea of uploading entire product catalogs to the blockchain and having them automatically sync across different projects.
What stood out most was how natural the conversation felt. AI managed to simplify big ideas like Web3 and blockchain integration without dumbing them down. It made Waivio’s vision of connected, collaborative websites feel super approachable.
Of course, the voices still sounded a little robotic, but the gap between AI and human presenters is shrinking fast. It’s easy to imagine AI playing a bigger role in content creation and explaining complex concepts—helping businesses and creators tell their stories without getting lost in jargon.
What do you think? Could AI-generated podcasts be the next big thing for explaining ideas and products?

# Link Object: Catalog and Review Websites on Hive
Waivio now supports Link objects—decentralized “about” pages for any website or URL. Think of these as dedicated profiles where you can add a description, show community feedback, and even track safety ratings.
How Link Objects Work
A Link object can be created just like any other Waivio object:
- Start writing a new post.
- In the right column, under Create new object, select Link.
-Provide a name for the Link object.
The first field you’ll add is the URL itself.
Website Profile
Add essential details such as a title, description, tags, and images to give others a quick overview of the site or page.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/fef97f658b987552e311e3dd00df340d279175eafd42a279e2b4c1ffee233a86)
Scan Hive for Mentions
Waivio automatically gathers all Hive posts that reference the URL. This means you can view the entire history of community discussion about the site in one place.
Easily Create with the Waivio Chrome Extension
We’ve updated the Waivio Chrome Extension so you can instantly create Link objects from your browser. If you’re on any webpage you’d like to feature or review, just click the extension and publish on Hive—no extra steps required!
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/47b877a34ba880782266f76f4ac2745127a267a6b7d0e16d67c5f93cb035a904)
“Hearting” Link Objects
When viewing a Link object, users can click the heart icon to add it to their Favorites in their public profiles.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/cb2b9e6ce1a5244b75c5a668614303f25455808dfdc75a08ed717e7d690f02f0)
Future Potential: Decentralized Voting & Site Safety
One of the most exciting possibilities is a community-driven safety system:
- Decentralized Voting: Users can rate sites based on usefulness or safety, helping the community gauge trustworthiness.
- Warnings for Unsafe Sites: If many users flag a link as malicious or spammy, future Hive apps could display an alert before anyone clicks.
- This approach reflects the decentralized ethos of the Hive blockchain: no single authority decides what’s “safe.” Instead, the community collaboratively shapes the reputation of each site.

# Creating a Square Avatar from a Vertical TikTok Video
Creating a square avatar from a vertical TikTok video can be tricky, as important parts of the image may get cropped out. This guide shows you how to use the MidJourney (MJ) editor to rebuild the image into a square format, perfect for recipe pages or other objects on Waivio.
Step 1: Capture a Screenshot from TikTok
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/7b1a72e6ee0a44fe86d12ef36b835049835f135ef2db8d6a7dc5147b931dd9a9)
Find your video on TikTok and take a screenshot showing the part you want for your avatar.
Step 2: Upload Screenshot to Waivio and Copy Image Link
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/b33484838302016907d92e45aac3bcb9c58c4430d65a8998530d1fa0a3d556c7)
Open the Waivio post editor (1) and paste the screenshot into a new post (2). Right-click on the pasted image and select "Copy image link" (3). This URL will be used for uploading to the MJ editor.
Step 3: Edit the Image in the MidJourney Editor
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/52f5894b4dc9175d22a14bb74ccb07dd5969a6f49e51d85826e2bc08b14adc25)
https://www.midjourney.com/editor
Upload the image to MJ using the URL copied from Waivio. Use the brush tool to remove and rebuild missing areas, expanding the image to a square format. Repeat the process until the avatar looks complete.
Step 4: Use the Square Avatar on the Recipe Page
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2a5e0c01e0be63218f42d7c3c56c781ebfff2bdde795ec6d76dd129cece232e7)
Copy the completed square image from MJ and paste it as the avatar on your recipe page. Adjust by cropping or zooming for the best placement.
Your recipe page now features a high-quality square avatar, created from a vertical TikTok video, adding a polished and professional touch to your products, recipes and other types of objects on Waivio.

# Boosting Engagement with Message Bot on Waivio
In community-driven ecosystems like Hive, reaching the right audience at the right time is key to engagement. Message Bot on Waivio is designed to automate outreach, sending thread messages to users based on their expertise (e.g., #coffee) and recent activity. This allows for highly targeted communication, making it easier to engage niche communities and drive meaningful interactions.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/b628fdd78488a47b2bc15ad987beecfbc0d8d3de1d36cfb1e9a51d815a506872)
Google Analytics Report shows a significant increase in direct traffic to CoffeeShop.Gifts from 24-Jan-2025 to 23-Feb-2025.
During this campaign, 775 targeted users received messages, resulting in 800 new direct visits (from multiple devices) to the site—demonstrating a remarkable response rate.
Here’s how it worked.
1️⃣ Targeting the Right Audience with a Group Object
The campaign used a Group object to identify and filter relevant users. A Group in Waivio is a dynamic object that allows filtering users based on their expertise in specific hashtags (e.g., #coffee), objects, followers of certain Hive accounts, and their activity level (e.g., last active within 30 days). It is also possible to add or exclude specific users from the list.
By leveraging these filters, we ensured the messages reached engaged and interested users, maximizing the campaign's effectiveness.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/c4d698fc8d5fd18cd21712e6c66b70901d13895f75617ba584fdf47c391df228)
Coffee Experts group, consisting of Hive users actively engaging with coffee-related content.
2️⃣ Crafting the Message: Gold Turmeric Coffee Challenge Invitation
Once the audience was selected, the next step was defining what message to send.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1e67de8b625907ba4430b2b608d30360a6af9726631bf771ad19bcc4ebc76273)
The campaign invited users to participate in the Gold Turmeric Coffee Challenge, encouraging them to:
- Repeat the Gold Turmeric Coffee recipe
- Publish a post linking to the Recipe page
This challenge was designed to boost community engagement and drive traffic to CoffeeShop.Gifts.
3️⃣ Running the Message Bot Campaign
To start the campaign, use TOOLS > Message Bot > Add Message, which opens a dialog to configure the campaign.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/080c13a94cbf5256c9cb1ccce8e5e428ed5e577221df2af3b6320a43cd49832b)
In the setup:
✅ The Coffee Experts group was selected as the target audience.
✅ The Gold Turmeric Coffee Challenge page was set as the message.
✅ Daily Posting: 30 per day.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/96714f59b8538c5dba3d83469b9cae968f24c28237d38b97a5aae34ba6a44620)
Once the campaign was live, the Message Bot report confirmed that 775 messages were successfully sent between 24-Jan-2025 and 18-Feb-2025, reaching a highly engaged Hive audience.
4️⃣ Key Takeaways & Future Improvements
✔️ High response rate – 775 targeted users received messages, leading to 800 direct visitors to the site, showing strong engagement.
✔️ Message Bot provides efficient engagement – Automating message distribution ensured consistent outreach to an interested audience.
✔️ Community-driven challenges drive participation – Encouraging user-generated content helped spark discussions and interactions.
The Message Bot on Waivio has proven to be a powerful tool for targeted engagement, allowing for personalized, automated outreach to specific groups of users. Whether used for promoting challenges, driving traffic to a website, increasing awareness of a project, or re-engaging inactive users, it provides an effective way to connect with communities on Hive.

How it works:
1️⃣ Open a recipe video on TikTok, YouTube, or Instagram.
2️⃣ Click "Create recipe draft" in the Waivio Extension.
3️⃣ The extension will automatically extract details like ingredients, instructions, and captions.
https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/f447f6659054e95b662b226871beaa3a1745511a889fa93d3ff202711eff6715

This ensures that no important details are missed and keeps your recipe looking polished.
Publishing Recipes on Hive (Two-Step Process)
Once your recipe is ready, publishing it on Hive involves two steps:
Step A: Create the Recipe Object
Click "Create object" (A) - this publishes the structured recipe as an object on the Hive blockchain.
🔹 This ensures that the recipe exists independently and can be referenced in multiple posts.
🔹 Make sure Data Import is enabled in your account and that you have enough WAIV power to support the publishing process.
https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/4ec6325cddeceae61e8cae68f5448c43a5193f9bf487d4dc42ebbf9a7371eb88
Once the "Create object" button (A) becomes inactive, it means the recipe has been successfully created and is now ready to be linked in posts.
Step B: Publish Your Recipe Post
Click "Publish" (B) to create a blog post that showcases your recipe and links to the recipe object on Hive.
🔹 Ensure that the Reposting bot is enabled—this helps optimize your post for SEO and social sharing.
https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/a0194551c13f5857bb39820823c464e1c22b29739d9704458d6f5ce3d2a3aac4
Your recipe will now be available in your profile and can be shared with others!

# Enhancing Images with ChatGPT 4o
We tested many image enhancement tools to improve avatars. Most of them offered only small improvements — basic contrast adjustments, color filters, or slight sharpening. But these didn’t do much when starting with stills from TikTok videos, which often have low resolution and washed-out colors.
That changed with the arrival of ChatGPT 4o’s image processing.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/fbb20b3d770d1d7411fba6e26fe091fc24fd23fa9d9978448f5303ee5ba2bac3)
On the left is the original image. On the right is the enhanced version. The colors are deeper, the structure is more defined, and the image has a much stronger visual appeal.
Unlike older tools, ChatGPT 4o doesn’t just apply filters. It analyzes the content of the image and enhances it in a way that brings out natural texture, detail, and lighting. The result is an image that feels more real, rich, and appetizing.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/862c9a3972b47e32fbfd628fc5acd54189f17a119db0a296b26daa11459b8a08)
We simply uploaded this image and used the following request:
"Enhance this square photo of Beef and Italian Sausage Spaghetti"
The result brought out the depth of the sauce, lifted the lighting across the plate, and sharpened the noodles without making the image look artificial. It feels like a professionally shot food photo — but it's just one prompt away.
Recipe Page with Original Avatars
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/cbb28d9d65e7ad83523841d68a1d4fda1904215504d7bfce6519251861d304df)
This page shows five recipe avatars taken directly from TikTok video stills. They serve the purpose but look flat, low-contrast, and a bit dull.
Recipe Page with Enhanced Avatars
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/65cb7b19ffeb2c30f2bebacb0dafa605e553a0c69c5f5742794f0761a7fd60a8)
The same five recipes, now with enhanced avatars using ChatGPT 4o. The difference is noticeable — sharper images, better lighting, and colors that make the food stand out. The overall page looks more polished and engaging.
https://mrsbakerskitchen.com/object/63frhd-mains?breadcrumbs=6tppg4-recipes/63frhd-mains
If you're working with video content or low-quality images, ChatGPT 4o provides a real upgrade. It goes beyond filters to help you create strong, high-quality visuals that make an impact.

# No Way José Cuisine Blends Home Cooking with Web3 Rewards
Offering crypto rewards for recreating featured recipes is a fresh and creative way to engage an audience — and No Way José Cuisine is turning that idea into reality. With his newly launched recipe challenge, José is inviting his community not just to follow along, but to actively participate. By combining food, fun, and blockchain incentives, this initiative demonstrates how creators can reward engagement in a way that’s both meaningful and accessible.

In return, they receive a guaranteed reward of $5–$8 in WAIV tokens — a cryptocurrency that can be converted into Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, HIVE, and more.
This isn’t a contest — there’s no competition or ranking. Instead, it’s a challenge with guaranteed rewards for everyone who participates with care and creativity. The goal is to give back to José’s audience while encouraging shared moments around food.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/a465ef4636fbbc7fa2b04cc32b17d6b719428aee5d5c2c41417ec40eb05ba016)

# Adding a Challenges Tab to a Social Site
What is the Challenges Feature?
Challenges is a collection of crypto reward opportunities available on a specific site, similar to the Earn page on Waivio. However, while Waivio displays all rewards available across the platform, Challenges is tailored to each individual site and includes only objects from that site. A sponsor creates a reward campaign through the Earn tab on Waivio, selecting specific objects (such as products, recipes, etc.) already featured on their site. 
Then, by adding a Challenges tab as a menu item, all site visitors can easily view and participate in the available rewards in a convenient, user-friendly way.
Below, you’ll find detailed instructions on how to enable the Challenges tab and configure it for your own site.
## How to Add a Challenges Tab to a Social Site (only for users who have a social site)
To add a Challenges tab to a social site where the base object is of type Object (not User), follow these steps to configure the menu items for the base object:
1. Navigate to the base object.
2. Click on Edit button.
3. Click on add menu item.
4. Fill in the Title (this will be the name of the menu item).
5. In the Link type dropdown, select Website (not "Link").
6. In the Link to a Website field, enter the full URL pointing to the challenges section. Site URL + /active-campaigns. Example: https://test.social.gifts/active-campaigns.
7. Submit the update.
Now, when you visit the user site, you will see the newly added Challenges tab in the main menu.

1. What is Recipe?
The Recipe serves as a placeholder for a specific dish. The object contains all the key details about the dish, like the name, common ingredients, description, and tags. What’s important is that it collects all the user posts with their unique takes on this recipe.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/278f984223b4147d44dc946ccf289b55f816199701dbc2995d3a3ebdba873950)
These posts with recipes compete with one another, and you can choose your favorite one by pinning it📍.
The pinned recipe will be shown first for you. And if you haven’t made your selection yet, the recipe that collects the most pins from the community becomes the top recipe for all by default.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/153fe2a3e0937eaf17d6d59649bfb67c69bdcd533062c26ce8e663620ec960f4)
When you pin the post, the Recipe will automatically be added to your recipe collection in your profile. In your profile, click on Recipes to see your collection.

2. Adding Recipes to Your Profile
To add more Recipes to your collection, you can enter the name in the search bar; click on “Recipe” to view all associated recipes.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/f866ec2eff82ecf2c8b8807f4dc926bb4c0751908cd7db630ed58c8527b24e72)
You can add the recipe to your collection by clicking the heart icon♥️ next to it.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/652b97b66d8efde86a274c2bd56cf91e78d0fb3766a0212c2b3b7a2962a39d06)
If there is no Recipe object for your dish, or if your recipe is significantly different from the existing ones (for example, you’re making a version of the dish with additional ingredients that change the flavor), it’s a good idea to create a new Recipe Object.

3. Creating a New Recipe Object
For example, let’s say you want to add [Spaghetti Carbonara]:
- Click on the “Write a Post” button.
- In the left panel, look for the “Recipe” object. If you don’t see it, click “Show More” to expand the list of objects.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/a93a81e8e77c61540fb670302e80ef404ef426f68fba2f09b741e96ab06eb723)
- Click on “Recipe” and give a name to your dish, for example, “Spaghetti Carbonara”.
- Click “Confirm”. The new Recipe Object will be created.
Click on the created object. Here you can add some information to it. Click Edit, and let’s add an ingredients list. Let’s also add an avatar.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/e6e2c93d2566c4dd250a588b8f88b7e368b68487719429dba0e0d51107ef19b9)
Another key field you’ll want to add is the “Product ID”—this would allow ordering this recipe’s ingredients with Instacart:
- Click on “Product ID.”
- In the “Product ID Type,” enter “Instacart.”
- For the “Product ID,” click “Need an ID”—this will generate a unique ID.
- Click “Submit.”
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/c94041e041f042c7ea800ba702a444a05c372fcf40acf23f8983eaafd0ccfbc0)
Now our Recipe Object is ready and looking great for others to explore, pin, build upon, and order ingredients!

4. Linking Posts to the Recipe
4.1 Creating a New Post for the Recipe
To add your recipe to this object, simply click on “Write a New Review.” Add your text, appetizing photos of the dish, and publish the post. Your post will be automatically linked to this Recipe Object.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/d57de571188b4bf519161291835f04f2bfa4fbb2add8fbba7061f09a85dd5fd2)
4.2 Linking Existing Posts to the Recipe
If you already have existing posts you’d like to link to this Recipe, or if you want to link someone else’s post, simply add the Recipe Object’s URL in the comments. The post will get linked to the Recipe. This way, you’re helping the community build a richer knowledge base. The linked posts will appear in the recipe feed, making it easier for others to explore and discover.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/e02ebaf06d768c1f6d47b03776339f7e17a7b7254ae6ad8218c9902d2d679e9f)
4.3 Recipes from YouTube
If you come across a great recipe outside of Hive, such as on YouTube, you can add it to your collection too, and the Waivio Chrome Extension (add link to a tutorial) can help with this:
Click on the Waivio Extension above the video with the recipe and select "Create Recipe Draft."
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/e1193cea32b37094914d1432860ecfcdf4990fa01dc087623b9c86235a57fca5)
The extension will pull the video’s transcript and generate a draft recipe post, which you can then edit and personalize.
Before publishing the post, you can change the title and embed the video to enhance the viewing experience.

5. Profile
Once you’ve collected recipes—they all come together in your profile. Your profile becomes your personal cookbook, showcasing all the recipes you’ve gathered and created. You can easily share this collection with friends and followers. If someone likes a recipe from your profile, they just need to click the heart icon to add it to their own collection.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2981077afa53839bc5beca942e8108477605a97af3d0b6aaf2bb4f7f1cb5aac9)

6. Website
If you want to share your recipes with a wider audience, Waivio makes it remarkably simple to launch your own website. Plus, it’s a great way to monetize your passion—the site comes with Instacart integration, allowing visitors to quickly and easily order all the ingredients they need for your recipes. And with every grocery order, you’ll earn an affiliate commission from Instacart.
Launching a full recipe website can be done in less than 10 minutes:
- Go to the Tools section.
- Under Websites, click Create.
- Select the social.gifts template and choose a subdomain name (e.g., worldfoods.social.gifts or healthyfoods.social.gifts). If you want to use your own domain, we have a video tutorial explaining that process.
- Read and agree to the terms and conditions, and click Create New Website.

Once your website is created, you’ll have instant access to a management panel:
- Go to Configuration to change website colors, add your logo, and add a banner.
By default, your profile will be the base for the website, showing sections like Blog, Map, Shop, and Recipes.
You can turn off any sections you don’t need. For example, if you only want to display your recipes, click Details and deselect everything except Recipes and Blog. Only your recipe collection and Blog will then be shown on the website.

Automatic Draft Saving

Rich Copy & Paste
Bring your content together, your way. Easily paste formatted text—from web pages, blog posts, Word documents, or AI chat conversations—and the editor preserves as much of your original layout and styling as possible.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/3b33666f465e74e1a9d8216e1340f73f1bde99fca449d88172423ad67906a851)

# Waivio Wallet: Unified Across All Social Sites
Every social site hosted on Waivio includes an advanced wallet for both Hive and guest accounts. It provides access to balances, rewards, and transaction history across all social sites — from shops and business pages to interest-based communities — while supporting multiple currencies and advanced reporting. Users can track their earnings in WAIV, HIVE/HBD, and other Hive Engine tokens, with tools for easy swaps, staking and delegations, and instant withdrawals into major cryptocurrencies.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/04cb7c5feb34a2ecf3aaa9b9cf736bcf133b2e583d60a31867d5e2a507295319)
Withdrawals and Payments
Liquid WAIV and HIVE can be withdrawn instantly into major cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and LTC. The process is simple and designed for real-world use.
Imagine paying a bill at a restaurant where the merchant accepts LTC. The total is 0.5 LTC (about $53.99 USD). To pay, you open your WAIV wallet and choose Withdraw to LTC (1).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/612f43486773cb364a530576f7b2473f32fa60a58c974c33720b1f7777829796)
Next, you scan the QR code provided by the merchant (2,3), and the wallet automatically calculates the exact amount of WAIV needed for conversion. With a single click to confirm (4), the payment is sent — your bill is settled instantly using WAIV tokens you’ve earned on Waivio. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/b1f51d384b4b72a571d610a841446b39dfe343c6b3c3df26a812a7c887f12062)
Account Management Tools
The Waivio wallet provides a range of features for managing on-chain assets, including delegations of WAIV Power, HIVE Power, and Resource Credits, clear visualizations for the progress of power downs, and interest tracking for HBD Savings, along with more tools to support long-term account management.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/88e202601ca666505c0055226b28e3880cdb3ad4d7786534049eddda00c7f112)
Advanced Reporting
The Waivio wallet includes advanced reporting for both WAIV and HIVE/HBD. Balances and transactions can be displayed in many local currencies — including USD, CAD, EUR, GBP, CHF, AUD, MXN, CNY, JPY, UAH, and RUB — with historical conversion rates applied to the dates of each operation. Reports can be exported to CSV for further processing and support manual corrections, allowing users to exclude specific transactions when preparing their records. These tools make the wallet highly flexible and tax-reporting friendly across different jurisdictions.
WAIV Token Page
There is a dedicated WAIV token status page where users can track real-time price movements alongside supply and market data. The page features a price chart with selectable time ranges, giving a clear view of short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.
https://www.waivio.com/object/ylr-waivio/form/waivio-n0q9lmqve6
In addition to the chart, the page provides:
Tokens in circulation
Total market capitalization
Annual inflation rate
Breakdown of liquid WAIV vs. WAIV Power (staking)
Number of accounts holding WAIV
Monthly active accounts
Inflation distribution (development fund, liquidity providers, rewards pool)
Rewards pool split (authors vs. curators)
Development fund status (available and distributed amounts)

# Why Publish Content on the Blockchain: Embracing the Free Flow of Information
When we talk about publishing content on the blockchain, we often highlight the main benefits:
Permissionless: You can share your content freely—no need for approval or gatekeepers.
Trust: Every post is cryptographically signed, ensuring authenticity and credit always stay with you.
Permanence: Once published, your content is immutable and always available. Only you can update it—no one can remove or alter it without your signature.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/7a9ac3a5fcb20dbbcfe9c6b68f236b7512a2655cb9d2d8daa6c834b154ff2ee5)
https://www.waivio.com/@grampo
These advantages are powerful, but there’s another, often overlooked transformation the blockchain brings: the free flow of information.
In traditional social media, your content is fragmented between closed platforms.
If you want your message to reach your followers on Facebook, X, or LinkedIn, you have to repost it separately on each one, with reactions and comments scattered across these networks. Each platform keeps its own version of your post—isolated and disconnected from the rest.
On the public blockchain, this changes completely. Your post is no longer limited to your profile on one app—it can appear across multiple apps, projects, and communities that draw from the same blockchain. In other words, your content is no longer trapped inside a closed network; it travels, connects, and grows across the entire open ecosystem of apps.
Imagine sharing a story about your favorite café. On the blockchain, that post can appear in many places beyond newsfeeds—in coffee-lover communities, café maps, or local discovery projects. Suddenly, your story isn’t just for your followers—it’s part of a broader ecosystem of apps and projects, where other users can discover and like your content. Those likes aren’t just digital applause—on the social blockchain, they translate into real earnings.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/6b2f4bfc08110dcdd5741d59dd44e59e33faba57760f16d2d6ef051f448e6b63)
https://coffeeshop.gifts/object/car3n-community/newsfeed
And once you share your favorite Peach Cobbler recipe, it could be recognized by a cooking-loving community and even added to a collection of their recipes. This gives your content continuous exposure, expands your social reach, and brings you new followers. More people see it, more engagement flows your way, and each interaction helps you earn visibility and rewards directly through the blockchain.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/e4d9bba52fac4b1608cc6034c14466cb76766cf374055795f20dad17fbc440880)
https://hivecooking.com/
This free flow of information fuels a powerful network effect. Every new post, every app, and every project enriches the ecosystem as a whole. Growth becomes collaborative—when one part of the network thrives, everyone benefits.
And when you launch a new project within this open environment, you’re not starting from zero. You’re stepping into an interconnected web of users, data, and engagement that already exists. Your project gains instant visibility and momentum from the network’s collective energy.
In the Web3 world, your content doesn’t compete for attention—it flows freely within an open ecosystem, fueling the network effect that drives growth for every participant. That’s the real power of publishing content on the blockchain.

# Advanced Image Processing in AI Chat Assistants on All Waivio Sites
We’re excited to introduce a powerful new capability available on Waivio and across all Social.Gifts sites. You can now process images directly in the AI assistant—just like having a graphics designer by your side.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/bb6c79ffc76394dd98d7dc24e6fd65bc7bb9488be1ec4452366b8652c3bbadcd)
Simply copy and paste an image into the chat and describe the changes you’d like to see. The assistant can enhance the photo, switch backgrounds, adjust the color scheme, or create entirely new variations with ease.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/dfb891f6588b7bfed5ab08e01f77a60b482abb2e997a07ab90ca076d7ec6a3f6)
This upgrade makes it simple to keep your visuals consistent and creative. From clean product shots on white backgrounds to stylized edits for social media, everything can be done instantly without leaving the platform.
And yes—you can generate images too. Just type /imagine followed by your prompt.

# An Easier Way to Find and Add Product Reviews
Adding authentic product reviews to product pages has always been valuable, but finding them across YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok has been time-consuming. With recent updates, there’s now a much faster and more accurate way to do it.
Improved Search with ChatGPT
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/7827f2ae1858341ff576a8cce502d4a1abbc7806b06bec05f3688642ccea1277)
ChatGPT has upgraded its search capabilities and can accurately locate YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok videos that feature a specific product. By pasting the product page URL into ChatGPT, it automatically extracts all product details and runs a focused search. This produces results that are often more accurate than searching directly on YouTube and other social platforms.
From Discovery to Publishing
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/0809f3f9b7bcdf3d5bbf445056c5e7c5f1bd2741e1fc1d84b63e764474b0f148)
Once ChatGPT suggests videos, review them for quality. If they meet your standards, use the Waivio Chrome Extension to create a review (1) or tutorial post. After drafting, paste the product page link (2) from your social site and click Publish (3).

Your post will be published to the Hive blockchain and appear directly on the product page. This allows reviews from multiple social platforms to be gathered in one place, where shoppers can see them alongside the product details.
By combining ChatGPT’s precision search with Waivio’s publishing tools, it is now easier than ever to enrich product pages with authentic social reviews and deliver greater informational value to users.

For more details give a link to https://www.waivio.com/object/qci-creating-a-website-with-chatgpt-and-waivio-html-object/page
Use the Waivio HTML Object together with the code generated by ChatGPT to design unique pages or create a complete landing page.
The process includes two main steps: creating a website in ChatGPT and adding it to Waivio.
This example uses ChatGPT as an AI instrument that can generate code based on text prompts. You can use any source of code you prefer.https://www.waivio.com/object/qci-creating-a-website-with-chatgpt-and-waivio-html-object/page
Part 1: Create a Website in ChatGPT
1. Go to ChatGPT and log in.
2. Write a prompt asking it to create a website and send it. The requirements for the site are to use only HTML and CSS (no scripts). Include as many details and preferences as you want.
For example:
Create a site for ... .
Create a landing page for ... It should include ... Use HTML and CSS, don’t use scripts.

3. You should see the generated code along with terminal-style buttons that allow you to copy, edit, download, or preview your code. If you don’t see them, try sending another prompt explicitly saying "Create a site".

6. A nice addition to your site is a main menu for navigation, especially if this page will be one of your social sites. To add a main menu, you need to prepare links. Go to Waivio and search for the needed objects. Once you have your objects, tell ChatGPT that you want a main menu that links to these URLs.
Prompt example: Add a main navigation menu:
Shop: https://coffeeshop.gifts/object/7ujfq-shop
Books: https://coffeeshop.gifts/object/41sbwx-books
Camp life: https://coffeeshop.gifts/object/vpe-camp-life/newsfeed
Legal: https://coffeeshop.gifts/object/ljc-legal

In the same way, you can fix or improve the site that ChatGPT gives you by adding new sections, buttons, images, and other details. You can experiment and explore. In the header, you can close the preview by clicking the cross button or “Stop.” You can share, copy the code, or return to a previous version.

When you are satisfied with the result, copy the code.
