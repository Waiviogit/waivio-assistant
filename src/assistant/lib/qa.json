        "question": "How do WAIV token rewards work?",
        "answer": "On Waivio, rewards can be understood in two main ways: campaign-based rewards offered by sponsors and ongoing rewards for regular activity on the platform. Both are paid in WAIV tokens, which are the native reward and utility token of Waivio. WAIV tokens are used for creating campaigns, making payments, and rewarding user participation. Rewards shown in the Earn tab are displayed in the user's local currency but paid in WAIV, with the token's value in that currency serving as a key metric. They may be delivered through a combination of upvotes and direct payments, with only registered account upvotes counting toward fulfillment. Sponsored rewards are announced on the Hive blockchain by sponsors, and users can qualify for these rewards by completing specific tasks such as sharing opinions about products, books, or places, or by featuring sponsored products in posts, photos, or videos. These rewards are the primary way sponsors engage with users. Beyond campaigns, users can also earn WAIV tokens through ongoing activity on the platform—creating posts, engaging with content, curating, and participating in community-driven initiatives. This ensures that active contributors are consistently rewarded. Once earned, WAIV tokens can be held in two forms: liquid WAIV and WAIV Power. Liquid WAIV is flexible and can be spent on services such as hosting social shopping websites or purchasing VIP tickets, while WAIV Power represents a longer-term commitment and is used for voting, creating objects, and importing products. Users can convert between liquid WAIV and WAIV Power as needed. Finally, WAIV tokens are not limited to the Waivio ecosystem—they can be swapped for other tokens on Hive Engine or withdrawn into cryptocurrencies such as BTC, LTC, ETH, and HIVE. The Waivio Wallet provides tools for viewing transaction history, managing balances, and accessing swapping options.",

        "question": "What hosting costs are associated with social shopping websites?",
        "answer": "Active websites cost $1 USD per day, while inactive websites (name reservations) cost $0.20 USD per day. Payments are made in WAIV tokens, converted to USD at the current market rate. Hosting payments can be managed through the Manage tab using the 'Pay Now' button. The website's status can be changed with the active/inactive checkbox. Hosting works like a separate wallet for your site: you send WAIV tokens to it, and the system automatically deducts the daily fee based on your website's status. Funds in this 'site wallet' can only be used for hosting your website. For example, if you deposit the equivalent of $30 in WAIV tokens and keep your site active, it will run for 30 days. As your balance gets low, you will receive a notification.",

A full 100% upvote reduces your voting power by about 2%. Voting power regenerates automatically at around 20% per day, so if you use all of it, it takes about five days to fully recharge. On average, this allows you to make around 10 full-strength votes at 100% each day, or more votes at lower percentages. The value of your vote depends on the amount of staked tokens you hold (WAIV Power and HIVE Power). The more tokens you have staked, the higher the value and influence of your votes.

        "question": "What is Waiv Power? Why do I need it?",
        "answer": "Waiv Power is WAIV tokens that are staked to support on-chain operations and to determine the value of WAIV-based upvotes. It is required for actions such as imports, bots, and other internal Waivio procedures. The more Waiv Power you have, the stronger your upvotes will be, which increases the rewards you can distribute. If a post is eligible for WAIV rewards (tagged with 'waivio' or 'waiv'), users with Waiv Power can upvote it to allocate rewards. If the user themselves writes a post with these tags, they can receive rewards not only in HIVE but also in WAIV. In short, Waiv Power is needed both to perform updates on the platform and to influence reward distribution.",

    },
    {
        "question": "How can I write a post and receive WAIV rewards?",

A post becomes eligible when it includes the tags 'waiv' or 'waivio' (these are the main tags, though other related tags may also apply). Users with Waiv Power can then upvote your post, and those upvotes allocate WAIV rewards in addition to the regular HIVE rewards. In this way, Waiv Power is used not only to perform updates on the platform but also to influence and distribute rewards to posts.",
