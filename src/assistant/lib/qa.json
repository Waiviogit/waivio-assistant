        "question": "How do WAIV token rewards work?",
        "answer": "On Waivio, rewards can be understood in two main ways: campaign-based rewards offered by sponsors and ongoing rewards for regular activity on the platform. Both are paid in WAIV tokens, which are the native reward and utility token of Waivio. WAIV tokens are used for creating campaigns, making payments, and rewarding user participation. Rewards shown in the Earn tab are displayed in the user's local currency but paid in WAIV, with the token's value in that currency serving as a key metric.\n\n![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/19f065eaf0d19c4731f9f2b8abb7e9b561386cf721a15411b0e2cf4cde8faf19) They may be delivered through a combination of upvotes and direct payments, with only registered account upvotes counting toward fulfillment. Sponsored rewards are announced on the Hive blockchain by sponsors, and users can qualify for these rewards by completing specific tasks such as sharing opinions about products, books, or places, or by featuring sponsored products in posts, photos, or videos. These rewards are the primary way sponsors engage with users. Beyond campaigns, users can also earn WAIV tokens through ongoing activity on the platform—creating posts, engaging with content, curating, and participating in community-driven initiatives. This ensures that active contributors are consistently rewarded. Once earned, WAIV tokens can be held in two forms: liquid WAIV and WAIV Power. Liquid WAIV is flexible and can be spent on services such as hosting social shopping websites or purchasing VIP tickets, while WAIV Power represents a longer-term commitment and is used for voting, creating objects, and importing products. Users can convert between liquid WAIV and WAIV Power as needed. Finally, WAIV tokens are not limited to the Waivio ecosystem—they can be swapped for other tokens on Hive Engine or withdrawn into cryptocurrencies such as BTC, LTC, ETH, and HIVE. The Waivio Wallet provides tools for viewing transaction history, managing balances, and accessing swapping options.\n\n![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/e9b18884102085fe2b57b3ff4b2f76b6e71ebe461d155e2f85cc293ebca376fd)",

        "answer": "Start by creating a Business object to set up the foundation of your shop, including its details and branding. Then create a List object, for example call it 'Shop.' This list will act as your main catalog. To connect the list with the Business object, go to the Business object, click on 'Add menu item', select the List object, and submit. Your list will now appear as one of the main menu options, working as a catalog linked to your business object. Inside this list, you can create categories and subcategories (also as lists). Each category can contain products, books, recipes, or other items. You can also add other object types such as pages, webpages, newsfeeds, or widgets and organize them into lists to build a structured menu. Essentially, any object created on Waivio can be added as a separate entity and arranged through lists. To see all available object types, go to the editor (click the pencil button in the header) and see the right sidebar, or click 'Create new object' to view the full list of enteties (objects).For better organization and presentation, you can use ChatGPT to suggest categories, arrange menu items in a logical order, and add custom avatars to make your shop visually appealing\n\n![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1700520368_49682807-4879-473a-84a2-9de9dbadbe1f)",

Payments are made in WAIV tokens, converted to USD at the current market rate. Hosting payments can be managed through the Manage tab using the 'Pay Now' button. The website's status can be changed with the active/inactive checkbox. Hosting works like a separate wallet for your site: you send WAIV tokens to it, and the system automatically deducts the daily fee based on your website's status. Funds in this 'site wallet' can only be used for hosting your website. For example, if you deposit the equivalent of $30 in WAIV tokens and keep your site active, it will run for 30 days. As your balance gets low, you will receive a notification.\n\n![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1699907415_7755a35e-993d-4c29-a2e5-0e778f5bbdad)",

To do this, go to your Waivio wallet, click on Deposit button in left sidebar, select the token you want to deposit, and follow the instructions. After sending your cryptocurrency, it will appear in your Hive Engine Wallet (one of the tabs in the Wallet) as a swap version (for example SWAP.LTC if you deposited LTC). Once you receive the swap currency, you can exchange it for WAIV by opening the Hive Engine Wallet tab, clicking the 'Swap to WAIV' button next to your swap currency, choosing the amount, and submitting the transaction. Alternatively, you can use the general Swap button, where you select the 'from' and 'to' fields manually. After the swap, go to the WAIV tab to see your updated balance.

        "question": "How does voting power work?",
        "answer": "Voting power on Waivio determines the strength of your upvotes and how much influence they have on rewards. It starts at 100% and decreases with each vote you cast. A full 100% upvote reduces your voting power by about 2%. Voting power regenerates automatically at around 20% per day, so if you use all of it, it takes about five days to fully recharge. On average, this allows you to make around 10 full-strength votes at 100% each day, or more votes at lower percentages. The value of your vote depends on the amount of staked tokens you hold (WAIV Power and HIVE Power). The more tokens you have staked, the higher the value and influence of your votes. To maximize your impact, it is best to use your voting power strategically by voting on content you find most valuable when your voting power is higher.\n\n![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2c01a2bf3fc9319358bfb72b91485e185c1f45055ab0c9e5291863ed6463074a)",

        "answer": "To sign in to Waivio, you can choose one of three authorization options. If you are new, the easiest way is to use Google login. This creates a guest account with limited functionality: you will not have voting power, but you can still post, create a social site, and your username will include the prefix 'waivio_'. For full access, you need a Hive account. You can sign in with HiveSigner by using your Hive account credentials, or with HiveAuth (Hive Keychain) by scanning a QR code with the Keychain app on your phone for secure mobile authentication. If you don't yet have a Hive account, one option is to start by signing in with Google. As you participate in the platform by writing posts and earning rewards, you can accumulate the equivalent of 3 HIVE in WAIV tokens. Once you have enough, you can create a Hive account through the VIP ticket system (Tools > New Accounts). After that, you will be able to sign in using HiveSigner or HiveAuth (Hive Keychain) and gain full access to all platform features.\n\n![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1651446189_b2ddf46a-a173-4b8e-b62d-0988892e9fbd)\n![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/29368e21bae0746a6c596be89a3860aaee32903829b378f64ad59b63758d4086)",

Make sure you have enough power requirements: WAIV Power (each full upvote ≈ $0.0001) and HIVE Power for Resource Credits. Then log in to Waivio, go to Tools → Data Import and activate Data Import (switch should be green). In the same section, go to the Chrome Extension tab, download and set it up. After that, go to the site you want to import from, click on the Waivio extension, choose an import method, and press the Import button. The imported objects will appear in the Data Import tab on Waivio.  Some platforms (like Amazon or Walmart) offer more advanced export options, while others use the common 'Analyze with AI' feature. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/391d5e1737d2c4d4acd4c94a24e77406e99925d5581d5c9e8d47952dfdb46720)",

        "question": "Why should I publish my content on the blockchain instead of traditional social media platforms?",
        "answer": "Publishing on the blockchain gives you complete freedom, ownership, and reach that traditional social media can't match. Unlike closed platforms where each post is isolated, blockchain posts are permissionless, cryptographically verified, and permanent—meaning no one can remove or alter them without your consent. Once published, your content can appear across multiple apps and communities using the same blockchain, allowing it to travel freely and gain visibility beyond your followers. For example, a post about your favorite café could show up in coffee-lover communities or café discovery apps, where likes can even translate into real rewards. This open ecosystem creates a continuous flow of information and collaboration, fueling collective growth and giving your projects instant exposure and credibility.![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/7a9ac3a5fcb20dbbcfe9c6b68f236b7512a2655cb9d2d8daa6c834b154ff2ee5) https://www.waivio.com/@grampo",

        "question": "How can you connect a purchased domain to Waivio to create a custom website?",
        "answer": "To connect a GoDaddy domain to Waivio, first add your domain to Cloudflare, log in or sign up, and manually enter DNS records by creating an A record with the IPv4 address 206.189.200.117. Then, note the new Cloudflare nameservers. Next, go to your GoDaddy account, open the DNS settings of your domain, and replace the existing nameservers with those provided by Cloudflare. Once the setup is complete and Cloudflare verifies activation, go back to Waivio, open Tools > Create > Custom domain, enter your domain, accept the hosting agreement, and create your new website.

Then create an A type record with “@” as the name and “206.189.200.117” as the IPv4 address. Save the record, delete any other A records, and proceed to activation. Cloudflare will then display your new nameservers to use with your domain provider. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/59eb13d710faa81a47838e4fc03647f0b7e8cdf4b7f93b34ab657011cb68ce1d)",
