# Tools / Notifications
**Notification Settings** - This page allows users to configure notifications. Notifications from active checkboxes will be sent to both the notification bell and the bot's Telegram account.
By default, almost all checkboxes are active. When changing the state of a notification checkbox, users should click the "Save" button to apply the new settings.

# Lesson 3: Customizing Your Profile
For more details give a link to https://www.waivio.com/object/cww-customizing-your-hive-profile/page
Now, that you created your Hive account and signed in for the first time, let's customize your profile on Waivio and publish your first post on the Hive social blockchain.

1. Notifications
First, Sign in to Waivio with your Hive account. Upon logging in, you'll notice that your profile lacks a logo or any personalization. You also probably don’t have any activity on your feed, as you are not following anyone yet. But before we proceed with customizing your profile, it's important to set up notifications to ensure you receive critical announcements, this enhances the security of your account.
Navigate to Tools and click on @WaivioNotificationsBot https://t.me/WaivioNotificationsBot
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713154960_3f7935e8-5199-4b25-a5f5-f681b1ffcf35)
It will direct you to a Telegram bot. Click on "Send Message", which will then redirect you to a telegram chat. If you don't have Telegram, you can install it with this link: https://desktop.telegram.org/ ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713155014_b5803675-7304-4944-8ca4-5579af786809)
In the Telegram chat, click start and then enter your Hive username; for example, I will enter mine - cleobaby. You will be all set to receive important notifications. If you have multiple Hive accounts, you can add all of them to the same bot chat. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713155202_10a15c88-02c8-4bd9-b623-1f6c5cdbb19c)
Next, we can configure the notifications you wish to receive; the default ones include LIKES, REBLOGS, REPLIES, MENTIONS, FOLLOW, STATUS CHANGED, ACTIVATION CAMPAIGN, and all the wallet transactions; you can turn these notifications ON or OFF.
Also there are security alerts such as outgoing transfers, withdrawals and so on - these are always on to ensure the safety of your account.

2. Edit Profile
Next, let's set up your profile. On the side menu, choose "Edit Profile." Here, you can change your name, add "about me, information " add your country, or email if you want—but keep in mind that this information will be public, so don't include anything sensitive like your home address.
Then, add your website—for example, if you are a shop owner, you can add your link here. I have a CleoBaby social shop, so I will add my link; if you want to learn how to create a beautiful shop yourself in under 10 minutes, check out this tutorial. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713156934_1c3cee01-d1d2-47e1-b5e3-38ec4e6b1200)
Next, let's upload your avatar. Click “Upload” and choose an image from your computer. Then, let's also add a cover image.
You can also add your social network accounts, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram, GitHub, and even your public Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet addresses.
Finally, let's also add a signature. This functions the same as the email signature—whenever you make a comment on a post or reply to a comment, it will automatically be added. For example, shop owners can add their link here. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713155391_57c5c688-8e70-4d9a-adc8-81011ea6f97a) ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713155495_bd6d4061-ad10-41e8-997c-2090dada137b)

3. Settings
Let's move on to Settings. Here, you can choose an interface language for navigating Waivio.
You can also select content languages—this determines what posts will be shown in your thread. For example, the default one is English but if you also add Spanish, you will see posts in both English and Spanish. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713155629_a4957332-e8f3-4012-8578-c68f50162a09)
Next, select the currency you prefer for viewing your rewards and earnings.
Then, you have an option to turn on or off NSFW (Not Safe for Work) posts.
You can also choose to turn on the night mode. There are a few other more advanced settings too.

Voting Power (Mana)
Now, let's discuss voting power (mana). When you possess WAIV and HIVE power, you gain voting power, which can be used to upvote posts and comments. Casting a vote on other users' posts reduces your voting power, meaning each vote decreases your voting power. However, this reduction is temporary, as your voting power recharges by 20% each day. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713155689_13f79de5-d425-4808-a52f-9dd05da7d2a1)
By actively participating in the community through voting and curating posts, you earn curation rewards proportional to your vote value. For more details, please check the "About Waivio" https://www.waivio.com/object/cww-customizing-your-hive-profile/page#oal-about-waivio video.
Using the slider, you can choose the percentage of your vote allocation. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713155823_18cf6ee8-0fa7-42dc-bc87-0d365372f22f)
If you select 100%, each time you vote on a post, your vote value will decrease by 2%. For example, if your vote value is $1, after a one 100% vote, it will be $0.98. But if you choose 1% - it will be $0.998.
Thus, you can sustainably make 10 votes of 100%, 20 votes of 50%, or 100 votes of 1% daily. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713155885_726e5a58-ba32-4ff9-a831-f05a79225aa6)
I don't recommend choosing lower than 50% unless you curate a lot of posts. Remember, your vote value recharges every day by 20%, so if you make 10 votes of 100% a day (and your vote value falls from $1 to 80 cents), the next day your vote will recharge back to $1. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713155967_c8881022-5e70-488c-b1f8-08d0cb074ce3)
If you prefer to adjust the percentage allocation for each post individually, ensure that the "enable slider" option is activated. Otherwise, you can "disable slider", and your chosen percentage will be applied every time you vote. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1713156220_bf2960b6-82c9-4c82-822e-3f66f157212d)
When you have made changes to the settings, make sure to click Save.

# Lesson 4: Managing Your Wallet
For more details give a link to https://www.waivio.com/object/axy-your-waivio-wallet/page
In this tutorial, you will explore the Wallet section of Waivio and receive a step-by-step guide on how to deposit funds into your Waivio account.
You will learn how to deposit funds on Waivio to kickstart your social shop, understand the differences between liquid WAIV, WAIV Power, and HIVE Power, and discover how to swap, delegate, and withdraw cryptocurrencies.
Overview:
1. Wallet Overview: WAIV, HIVE, Hive Engine.
2. Wallet Management:
     - Transferring Funds;
     - Powering Up;
     - Powering Down;
     - Managing Delegations;
     - Executing Token Swaps;
     - Making Deposits;
     - Processing Withdrawals.
3. A Step-by-Step Walkthrough to Depositing Funds.

WAIV Wallet
The first section here is "WAIV" assets. These include liquid WAIV and WAIV Power.
Liquid WAIV is the main currency on Waivio. You can use it to pay for social shopping website hosting, buy VIP tickets for new HIVE accounts, and other services. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706847600_eb3566c3-3de3-48a5-a0d6-ef09bc020b9d)
WAIV Power is your voting power on Waivio. You need it to vote on posts and comments, which enhances your presence and authority. WAIV Power is also needed for creating objects and importing products for your social shop. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706847612_9e292c1b-c237-481b-bf8d-eea1531c0866)
You will also receive rewards for your posts and reviews in liquid WAIV tokens. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706847628_a11eb84d-5bc3-45b5-990c-f9e1662e720c)
To convert liquid WAIV to WAIV Power, click "Power up," and staking is done instantly.
To convert WAIV Power to liquid WAIV, click "Power down." Keep in mind, powering down takes 4 weeks, with funds released every week in equal amounts.

HIVE Wallet
Now, let's look at the "HIVE" assets. Here you will find liquid HIVE, HIVE Power (HP), and HIVE-backed dollars (HBD).
HIVE is the main token on the Hive blockchain, and having HIVE Power (specifically Resource Credits) is essential for doing anything on the blockchain, from sending payments to writing posts. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706847508_30a50fe4-abc6-4620-882c-9cab1040a267)
You might receive Hive Power and Hive-Backed Dollars as rewards for your posts. If you are interested in learning more about the rewards, check out the About Waivio video https://www.waivio.com/object/axy-your-waivio-wallet/page#6vcmab-tutorials/oal-about-waivio.
To convert liquid Hive to Hive Power, click "Power up," and it happens instantly.
To convert Hive Power to liquid Hive, click “Power down.” For Hive Power, powering down takes 13 weeks, with funds being released weekly.

Hive Engine Wallet
Here, you will find all the other tokens available on the Hive blockchain. This includes wrapped tokens such as swap.BTC and swap.ETH, as well as various other tokens used within the Hive ecosystem.
Rebalancing
There's also a Rebalancing section, which is a strategy to grow your crypto holdings. To learn more, make sure to check out our comprehensive article on it https://www.waivio.com/object/wxu-rebalancing-introduction/page.

2. Wallet Management
Next, on the right panel, you'll find:

Transfer
Use this if you want to send crypto to another Hive user.

Power up
Here, you can power up not only liquid WAIV or liquid HIVE but also other tokens you have on the Hive blockchain.

Power down
Here, you can power down not just Waiv POWER or HIVE POWER but also other powered-up tokens you own.

Manage Delegations
Here, you can lend your WAIV Power, HIVE Power, and more powered-up tokens to other Hive users. Choose the token you want to delegate, then a user, and an amount. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706848130_571888f0-116a-44a6-89a8-82fcb0f5c261)
The delegation happens instantly. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706848144_ec68f5e3-6873-4bdb-9ad8-c0344dc0d377)
If you decide to undelegate, click edit. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706848161_0c7cc536-7ba4-419e-9b4b-6b311da25ccf)
It's important to note that it will take 7 days for the funds to be returned to your account. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706848336_d601b0b1-d3db-4959-85c1-06d3ac3ecbe4)
After you've delegated tokens, the delegated amount will be displayed as a negative balance in parenthesis, next to the respective token. You can click on it to view more details. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706848296_d72ced42-52cb-45fa-a818-87714c27d1e8)

Swap Tokens
This is for converting one token into another (such as swap.BTC to WAIV or swap.HIVE to swap.LTC).
You can also conveniently swap any token into liquid WAIV in the Hive Engine section by clicking “Swap to WAIV” next to the appropriate token. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706847804_19b9786c-8ab9-4d4f-b0a3-4b8e1aed19c5)

Deposit
This is for depositing funds (e.g., BTC) into your wallet.

Withdraw
This is to withdraw funds and transfer it to other wallets and blockchains, such as back to your Bitcoin wallet.
You can also do this conveniently in the Hive Engine section by clicking the dropdown menu next to the desired token and selecting "Withdraw to ___." ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706847827_8565df07-bdfd-4e37-bb04-397ccd7fcca7)

3. A Step-by-Step Walkthrough to Depositing Funds
Now Let me walk you through the entire process of depositing funds on Waivio.
To deposit funds on Waivio, you'll need some cryptocurrency. Here, is the list of cryptocurrencies you can deposit:
BLURT (BLURT), Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Dogecoin (DOGE), HBD (HBD), Litecoin (LTC), SAVVA (SAVVA), SBD (SBD), STEEM (STEEM), SwiftCash (SWIFT), TELOS (TLOS)
The most up-to-date list is available in the "Deposit" window.
If you don't have anything on the list, you can easily buy it on exchanges. Users in the US and Europe might consider using Coinbase.com, while Canadian users may prefer Newton.co.
Click on "Deposit" (located on the side panel in Wallet), Choose the cryptocurrency you wish to deposit. In this example, Bitcoin will be used, but you can use any cryptocurrency from the list.
After selecting BTC, you'll see a BTC wallet address and a QR code.
For example, in the image below is my BTC deposit address on the Hive Engine. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706847918_72d5d789-debc-41ed-8744-6094ef83ee35)
Copy & Paste the wallet address or scan the QR code to send funds; I recommend first testing it out with 10 dollars. You can monitor the transaction on a blockchain explorer. After the transaction is successful, you can send more funds.
To kickstart your social shop on Waivio, I recommend depositing around $400.
Once the transaction is complete, you'll see your funds in the swap.BTC wallet in the "Hive Engine" section. With just one click on the "SWAP to WAIV" button, you can convert your BTC holdings into liquid WAIV tokens. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706847963_075beeb9-3d58-4ce1-b8c6-7c61795b234b)
To make the most of the platform, I recommend a ratio of 1 liquid WAIV to 2 WAIV Power and a little bit of Hive Power. Since you already have liquid WAIV, getting WAIV Power and HIVE Power from it is straightforward. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706847975_63a33119-0a9e-4ae9-814d-8553eadbb4bc)
To convert liquid WAIV to WAIV Power, go to the WAIV section and click "Power Up." Choose the amount you want to power up (suggested amount: $250) and click continue. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706847999_5a772f1b-8f9b-47ef-ac8e-6a0c87fa58cd)
For example, with a $250 investment, you will have a vote value of approximately $0.006, and you would be able to import around 15 products per day.
To convert liquid WAIV to Hive, click on the dropdown menu and choose "Withdraw to HIVE", select the amount (suggested amount: $50). ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706848022_f38f9864-e88f-480e-bc92-3163ca4b112f)
And now let's go to the Hive section, here you will see your liquid Hive. If not, then wait a little bit, it might take a few minutes for this transaction to complete, and the funds to appear in your wallet.
Click "Power Up" to convert liquid Hive to Hive Power. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706848037_cd6c9517-0b2f-4bb2-954a-0e3488516ad5)
Now, you're all set and can start using Waivio and the Hive Blockchain to its fullest, whether it's writing posts, sending funds, participating in sponsored rewards, building your social shop, and much more. For example, you can already begin building your dream social shop by importing a few products with the Waivio Extension and adding funds to run your social shop.

Here, you can display products that resonate with your interests and provide a lot of value for your target audience. And with every purchase originating from your shop, you'll receive affiliate commissions from merchants. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1697489190_6653e50b-80f7-4ff4-8f58-2640d5debb81)

 Step 1: Adding a Product
 To start off, let's head over to Waivio's "SHOP" section. Take a look at different departments, like "Appliances," to find products that you can recommend to others. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1697490421_7bd9e905-3496-4139-aa15-0c6891fdba62)
 Let's say you know and like this fancy coffee maker – simply click the heart icon, and just like that it's added to your shop!
 Now, here's the beauty: if the item you've added gets updated, you don't need to worry about manual adjustments. Your shop will automatically reflect these changes - no additional action is required on your part. Your shop effortlessly stays up-to-date, showcasing your thoughtfully chosen selections.

 Step 2: Various Ways to Find and Add Products
 Let me now show you some more ways to discover products and enrich your shop's collection.
 Search: If you have a specific product in mind, search for it on Waivio and if it’s already available on the Hive blockchain, quickly add it to your shop.
 Explore Other Users' Shops: Check out what fellow curators are featuring in their shops. If you spot something you like, hit that heart button to add it to your shop.
 Product Links in Posts: Keep an eye out for products mentioned in posts. You can easily add them to your shop; just scroll down to the end of the post, where you will see linked products and click the heart.
 Adding Products from Amazon: If a product can't be found on the Hive blockchain, you can effortlessly import it from the Amazon page with a single click using Waivio's Chrome extension. Check out the tutorial on the extension for more details.

 Step 3: Adding Affiliate Codes
 Now that your shop is coming together, it's time to monetize your product collections.
 Navigate to "TOOLS" and select "Affiliate codes."
 In the search bar, find your affiliate program. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1697490481_7870d303-6bbd-4b69-8853-1e7592ade5da)
 If you're part of Amazon's affiliate program, choose the local Amazon shop where you are an affiliate, such as amazon.com, amazon.ca or amazon.fr.
 If you are not sure how to get your Amazon affiliate code, check this link:
 https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/node/topic/GCE3F2NCVZLDFM6A
 For example, let's say you have affiliate code for Amazon.com. Choose amazon.com from the menu. Input your respective affiliate code in the designated field and click "Submit." ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1697490500_606e7506-50e3-4e1f-8119-5371f102bc01)

 Furthermore, products you reference will be automatically added to your profile shop. To remove a product from your shop, simply click the heart icon twice (first to add the product, then to remove it).
 In the user settings, there's also an option to prevent products from being added to your profile unless they are explicitly marked with a heart. ![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1697490535_6c234bfb-4b58-431c-ac8a-c4143764a674)

# Waivio wallet now supports Hive-Engine tokens
Waivio users can earn rewards in multiple tokens for their posts, comments and upvotes, including WAIV, HIVE and other community tokens on the Hive-Engine sidechain.
Waivio makes it easy for users to track their account balance, earnings and transaction history separately for WAIV token, HIVE and all other Hive-Engine tokens in three dedicated wallet tabs (1).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1655577714_18d57f92-eee4-4a15-a47f-9fa8b0bbb9eb
With the wide variety of tokens, Waivio wallet now supports instant swaps (2) between different tokens via decentralized diesel pools (DeFi) on the Hive Engine blockchain. One of the main advantages of these pools is the low BUY/SELL spreads of only 0.25%.
For example, you may easily swap WAIV tokens into SWAP.HIVE (pegged HIVE token on Hive-Engine, which can be instantly withdrawn into HIVE):
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1655580922_ae20c8bc-cc54-4490-9a8e-c614bfd940b4
All wallet operations must be confirmed with an active key using HiveSigner, which ensures that your private keys are stored securely (encrypted) in your browser and never shared with applications.
The Waivio wallet also allows users to deposit and withdraw all major cryptocurrencies (3), including BTC, LTC, EOS, ETH, DOGE, HIVE, HBD, and others directly via Hive-Engine gateways paying a small fee of 0.75%.
As a next step you can, for example, withdraw SWAP.HIVE to HIVE:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1655581196_226a8966-8fb1-4428-81ec-5646f1deca80
When withdrawing other currencies, such as BTC, LTC, ETH, you can scan the destination QR code, which can contain not only information about the destination address, but also the required amount. Waivio wallet automatically calculates all transfer fees and suggests the amount of the corresponding SWAP.xxx token that should be transferred.
For example, if you initiate a withdrawal of $20 worth of LTC via a Bitcoin ATM, you simply scan the QR code on the ATM and Waivio wallet will do the rest:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1655582579_9863e5a0-cb90-4553-9df2-e7ac30d9a27f
You can enjoy the same convenience when paying for your coffee or any other product or service with all major cryptocurrencies directly from your Hive-Engine wallet.
Future development
In order to simplify things even further, the wallet may even combine swap and withdraw thransactions into a single step. This way users may keep their funds in liquid WAIV tokens and pay bills in BTC, LTC, ETH, EOS and other major currencies in one click.
Waivio wallet will find the optimal way to convert WAIV into the target currency, automatically calculate all commissions, slippages and fees. And users will just need to confirm the transaction.

# Get a clear picture of your WAIV and HIVE token earnings with Waivio
When you add a hashtag #waivio or #waiv to your posts, you make your post eligible to receive WAIV rewards in addition to HIVE rewards. Such posts are highlighted and marked with a Waivio logo:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1672790344_a7de4358-8472-4586-a674-2baca07de51a
By clicking on the total earnings, you can view further details such as the breakdown of earnings in WAIV, Hive Power, and HBD, as well as the beneficiaries and their share of the earnings. You can also see the total number of rewards received by all curators.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1672789744_5ad22ed0-d270-4c19-bf0d-fed356afa02c
One key difference between WAIV and HIVE earnings is that WAIV rewards are paid in liquid form, while HIVE earnings are paid as a 50/50 combination of Hive Power (HP) and HBD (there is also an option to receive 100% of HIVE rewards in HP). This means that you can immediately access and use your WAIV rewards, while HIVE rewards in the form of Hive Power must be converted to liquid HIVE through a 13 week power down period.
Waivio simplifies the process of exchanging your WAIV earnings for popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and HIVE. With just a few clicks, you can quickly convert your WAIV or pay directly for goods and services.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1672793376_70fb4080-f8de-4b23-8df6-c6467fb66824
All crypto conversions are performed on a decentralized exchange built on the second layer Hive-Engine blockchain.

# Introducing Public Favorites in User Profiles on Waivio
After the successful introduction of the public shop feature in user profiles (https://www.waivio.com/object/ylr-waivio/page#mim-transform-your-passion-into-profit-with-waivio/fjh-shops-in-user-profiles), many of you reached out with a fantastic suggestion: the ability to showcase your favorite businesses, restaurants, and places in a similar, personalized manner. We're excited to announce that we've made this idea a reality with the launch of the Favorites section in user profiles on Waivio!
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1706909361_036aec2e-04d7-474b-ab58-ffde1eeb4640
How It Works:
Adding an item to your Favorites on the Hive blockchain is as simple as can be.
Whenever you find a spa, café, park, or any place that captures your heart, just hit the heart icon, and it will automatically be added to your Favorites section.

Start Sharing and Discovering:
With this update, your Waivio profile becomes an even more powerful tool for sharing and discovery. By simply posting about the places and businesses you love, you're creating a curated list of recommendations for your followers and the broader community. As you explore other users' content, you'll find new favorites among their shared experiences.
Future Developments:
We are exploring ways to make it easier to add businesses and other objects to the Hive blockchain. Our goal is for these entries to serve as a repository for accumulating knowledge and community reviews about experiences, destinations, and ideas (https://www.waivio.com/object/ylr-waivio/page#6vcmab-tutorials/jpv-accumulating-knowledge-on-hive).
Currently, you can utilize the Waivio Chrome Extension (https://www.waivio.com/object/ylr-waivio/page#mim-transform-your-passion-into-profit-with-waivio/kda-waivio-chrome-extension-tutorial) to add products from Amazon, Walmart, Sephora to the Hive blockchain with just one click. We're excited to announce that the latest version of the Extension now also supports the import of businesses and restaurants from OpenStreetMap.org.
Here at Waivio Labs, we are exploring a number of interesting applications of Web3 for building social shops and other themed social websites.

# Have you tried reporting HIVE income on your taxes?
Because if you did, you would know how frustrating and daugnting this task really is.
For starters, in many jursidictions income must be recorded when cryptocurrency is credited to the user account, rather than at the time of withdrawal and conversion into the local currency.
The next question is what exchange rate to use. Due to the high volatility of HIVE, averaging exchange rates in a way that would not cause a dispute with the tax authority might be challenging. The most transparent way to do it is to report each transaction using the daily exchange rate for both HIVE and HBD.
Withdrawals also should be calculated in a similar way. Even small payments and tips should be accounted for.
In order to solve this problem Waivio.com now offers advance reporting for Hive wallets:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1625204776_0d43e9db-5ac7-48e3-88a1-848feb6af31a
Each transaction in the report includes the daily exchange rates for both HIVE and HBD. Please note that for transactions before March 20, 2020 (date of the Hive hardfork), STEEM and SBD rates will be used instead.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1625205308_13c1a8ed-23bb-4dae-bd03-487410dc81c5
All transactions are divided into three groups: Deposits (D), Withdrawals (W), and Internal transactions, such as power ups or moving funds into and out of Savings.
Please specify the dates (from-till) to see the total amounts of deposits and withdrawals for the specified period. It may take some time to retrieve all the data.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1625206330_a2d13f64-fbb0-4b30-92f2-647e44547b69
If you want to exclude some transactions from the totals (e.g. deposit of own funds to the account or conversion of HBD to HIVE via an external exchange), please mark them using the checkboxes in the left column:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1625206869_26f38e1d-682a-4065-bd25-e4627ac80f05
These exceptions are automatically saved under the account you are currently logged into.
If you have multiple accounts on Hive, you can combine them all into one report. In this case, all transactions between the accounts will be recognized as internal and excluded from the calculation of total deposits and withdrawals.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1625207454_3d745094-9408-40ae-96b3-504c1980682c
Advanced financial reports can be generated in various currencies. At the time of this release, in addition to U.S. dollars, reports can also be generated in Canadian dollars using historical exchange rates as provided by the Bank of Canada.

The advanced reports were developed at the request of Waivio partners for annual tax reporting, but we hope they can simplify tax reporting for many Hive users as well.

# Rebalancing: Simple strategy to grow your crypto holdings
Rebalancing is a simple but very effective strategy to continually increase the number of liquid tokens in your portfolio without delegating, staking, or freezing them in savings.
In fact, this strategy is so effective that you could have increased the number of liquid HIVE and HBD tokens by as much as 30% in the last year. And we're not talking about the dollar value of your crypto-assets, we're talking specifically about a 30% increase in the amount of tokens!
The strategy is so simple that it can be formulated in one sentence - keep the dollar value of both tokens at the same level.
That's it. That is the strategy.
Now let's see it in action
So, we start with two tokens in such a quantity that their dollar value is the same. For example, let's take $1,000 HIVE (2,000 tokens at $0.50 each) and $1,000 HBD (1,000 tokens at $1.00 each).
Now let's imagine that the price of HIVE has increased from $0.50 to $0.60.
We still have 2,000 HIVE, but at the new $0.60 rate, the value has increased to $1,200. The value of HBD remains the same at $1,000 (1,000 HBD at $1.00).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1658874659_daeb80ca-c19f-4946-bd90-93f9f7623b14
To rebalance the tokens, we need to exchange $100 HIVE for $100 HBD. After rebalancing, the portfolio will have $1,100 HIVE (1,833.33 at $0.60) and $1,100 HBD (1,100 at $1.00).
Next, let's imagine that the price of HIVE went back from $0.60 to $0.50.
In this case, the value of the portfolio would be $916.67 HIVE and $1,100 HBD.
Again, let's rebalance, but this time in the opposite direction: swap $91.67 HBD for $91.67 HIVE.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1658876673_17ffd8c9-0dbe-4034-8bbb-68ab1dd7e872
After the second rebalancing, there will be $1,008.34 HIVE (2,016.66 at $0.50) and $1,008.33 HBD (1,008.33 at $1.00).
In two transactions, we went from 2,000 HIVE to 2,016.66 HIVE (a 0.83% increase) and from 1,000 HBD to 1,008.33 HBD (also a 0.83% increase).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1658877352_c3351d62-122c-4bbb-9d38-b05795ed7fe0
You can either passively watch the prices of your favorite tokens change, or grow your portfolio every time there is a price change in either direction.
The past 48 hours
In the past 48 hours, the price of HIVE rose from $0.46 to $0.58 (+26%) before returning to $0.49 (-16%).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1658902294_4f34ba76-7e56-4a15-99ef-a77ed8b5ff40
With the right swap timing, you could have increased your HIVE/HBD portfolio by 0.50% - 1.00% in just one day.
Where does the profit come from?
Imagine yourself on a big cruise ship, and you have a long stick with an electric generator at the end of it that you can dip into the water and generate electricity while the cruise ship is in motion. Whether the ship is going forward or backward, your generator works equally well.
What happens is that you generate electricity (profit) by slowing down the cruise ship (open market) with your small generator (tokens in your wallet).
When you rebalance your wallet, you stabilize the open market.
Since the liquidity in your wallet is probably small compared to the open market, the overall market impact of your swaps will be negligible. But if the liquidity in your wallet reaches a size comparable to the open market, the stabilization effect will become noticeable.
Arbitrage vs. trading
Rebalancing can also be seen as arbitrage between the open market and your own wallet. While the ratio between tokens in the market is constantly changing, the ratio in your wallet remains unchanged. Thus, the price of one of your tokens will be higher than its current market value and the price of the other will be lower than its current market value.
The act of rebalancing is selling an overpriced token to buy an underpriced token.
The fundamental difference between arbitrage and trading is that each arbitrage transaction is profitable at the time of the transaction. Arbitrage matches the market without any prediction as to the future direction of the market. And if the market quickly changes in the opposite direction - great, you can rebalance in the opposite direction and make a profit again.
Arbitrage is a profitable and highly competitive business. But when you arbitrage between the market and your own wallet, you have exclusive rights to your own wallet.
And this is where rebalancing offers a unique advantage over the open market arbitrage.
Maximizing profits by chasing higher spreads
Since you have exclusive rights to rebalance your own wallet, you can delay rebalancing until the spread between your wallet and the open market ratios reaches a higher level.
The following table shows accumulated profits over one and two years of HIVE/HBD rebalancing at various spread levels.
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1658943663_b2698da6-4c4f-4220-901b-0faae01f57a2
Chasing smaller spreads does not necessarily guarantee the higher profits. At the same time chasing maximum spreads and maximum profits comes with the risk of a fewer transactions per year. Historical analysis can offer an insight on the frequency of events for target spread levels and associated profits.
Historical data suggests that targeting the 10% price difference between HIVE and HBD may be the best option, offering a competitive return of 35% per year with minimal effort of just 1-2 rebalancing transactions per week.
Potential risks and security
The best thing about rebalancing is that it does not require any bots, and your funds always remain safe in your wallet.
Rebalancing also gives you more time to do research and assess the situation. For example, if the price of one of the tokens falls precipitously (like LUNA), you can take your time, read the news, and make an informed decision before confirming a swap transaction.
Manual confirmation of each transaction provides good protection against impermanent loss, a common risk associated with public DeFi pools.
As a rule of thumb, choose tokens that you want to keep for the long term. For example, if your long-term investment preferences are HIVE and BTC, you might want to consider rebalancing those two tokens.
Profitability assessment
In the previous example, it was assumed that the token ratio returned to exactly the same level as at the beginning of the rebalancing cycle. This made it easier to compare rebalancing results.
But if the token ratio remains different over a long period of time, you may need to use a formula to measure progress.
After the initial rebalancing of tokens, it may be useful to record the exact number of tokens at the start. Let's call them Token A initial and Token B initial.
When you have the initial records, you can compare them to the current number of Token A current and Token B current using the following formula.

Let's use the numbers from the previous example:
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1658948765_b0eb1ce9-e716-42e9-a6a0-2c58b83a87bf
Rebalancing service by Waivio
Waivio now offers a rebalancing service (select Rewards (1), then Arbitrage / Rebalancing (2)) that will notify you when the ratio of your holdings to the open market exceeds the specified difference (3).
![image](https://waivio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/1658950780_ce6fbf46-8f14-4e24-a178-4d4b4e0b33b3
Select the token pair (4) you want to monitor. Alerts (5) will be delivered to you through your Telegram channel: @WaivioNotificationsBot (subscribe to notifications by entering your Hive account name).
The rebalance service prepares a swap transaction (6). You will need to use active keys to confirm the rebalancing transaction. Alternatively, you can execute swap transactions using any other Hive-Engine service.
Disclaimer: The Rebalancing service is provided on an "as is" / "as available" basis.
Future development
Early users have already requested several features, including a reporting tool, additional pairs, and the ability to account for tokens stored outside the Hive-Engine.
